In a new preface and appendix, Professor Rostow extends his analysis to include recent economic and political developments as well as the advances in theory concerning nonlinear and chaotic phenomena. For those coming to his work for the first time, the original text and the introductions and appendices from earlier editions are included. This volume will not only be of interest to those concerned with the theory of economic growth, but also to students of policy since the 1960s. In the text Professor Rostow gives an account of economic growth based on a dynamic theory of production and interpreted in terms of actual societies. Five basic stages of economic growth are distinguished with detailed discussions of each stage including illustrative examples. He also applies the concept of stages of growth to an examination of the problems of military aggression and the nuclear arms race. The final chapter includes a comparison of his non-communist manifesto with Marxist theory. Materials from the second edition include an appendix in which he responds to some of his critics.</p><p>Five basic stages of economic growth are distinguished in an account of economic growth based on a dynamic theory of production and interpreted in terms of actual societies.W.

What led Paul&#x2015;in his dramatic conversion to Christianity&#x2015;to such a radical critique of Jewish culture?<br><br>Paul's famous formulation, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, no male and female in Christ," demonstrates the genius of Christianity: its concern for all people. The genius of Judaism is its validation of genealogy and cultural, ethnic difference. But the evils of these two thought systems are the obverse of their geniuses: Christianity has threatened to coerce universality, while ethnic difference is one of the most troubled issues in modern history.<br><br>Boyarin posits a "diaspora identity" as a way to negotiate the pitfalls inherent in either position. Jewishness disrupts categories of identity because it is not national, genealogical, or even religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension with one another. It is analogous with gender: gender identity makes us different in some ways but not in others.<br><br>An exploration of these tensions in the Pauline corpus, argues Boyarin, will lead us to a richer appreciation of our own cultural quandaries as male and female, gay and straight, Jew and Palestinian&#x2015;and as human beings.</p><p>"A splendid piece of work: learned, witty, wide-ranging in its understanding of religion as a cultural phenomenon, passionate in its concern for the ethical implications of our reading of ancient texts."&#x2015;Richard B. Hays, author of <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</i><br><br>"Boyarin's bracing argument turns us into strangers to ourselves, as the first century comes uncannily close to the twenty-first century. The importance of this stimulating and controversial book lies in promoting an awareness of the possibilities of solidarity, justice, and liberation in the time of the culture wars."&#x2015;Homi K. Bhabha, author of <i>The Location of Culture</i><br><br>"Brilliant, thought-provoking and outrageous (a compliment in my lexicon). Demonstrates very clearly the merits of a Jewish look at Paul (that is, a Jew looking at Paul in his Jewishness)."&#x2015;Adele Reinhartz, McMaster University<br><br>"Boyarin has mastered the literature of Paul in amazing detail and devastating understanding. His analytic skills are honed to perfection on the stone of critical theory. As a Jewish reader of a foundational Christian text, he has explained to Christians the power of Paul's thinking for Christians."&#x2015;Burton L. Mack, author of <i>Myth of Innocence: Mark and Christian Origins</i><br><br>"This book is a polemic for difference based on genealogical memory as a creative force in the broadest human solidarity. In that sense it is a moral or philosophical tractate, what Boyarin calls cultural criticism, as well as an analysis of Paul's position. I have been greatly informed by a reading of this study."&#x2015;Antoinette Wire, author of <i>The Corinthian Woman Prophets</i><br><br>"Boyarin weighs in with his usual �clat . . . reading the Epistles as if they were contributions to contemporary debates over the issues of feminism, multiculturalism, Zionism, identity politics, and deconstruction, and reading these as if they were germane to an understanding of the Epistles. The book is a tour de force of PoMo criticism, and required reading for anyone interested in the history of religion, Judaism, Christianity, Western culture, 'Orientalism,' identity politics, feminism&#x2015;and the list could go on."&#x2015;Hayden White, author of <i>Metahistory</i><b>Daniel Boyarin</b> is Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture at the University of California, Berkeley.

This volume begins by reviewing and rethinking the concept of national cinema in an age of globalisation.</p><p>Why do we think of clusters of films as &#39;national cinema&#39;? Why has the relationship between the nation and film become so widely and uncritically accepted? &#34;Theorising National Cinema&#34; is a major contribution to work on national cinema, by many of the leading scholars in the field. It addresses the knotty and complex relationship between cinema and national identity, showing that the nationality of a cinema production company, and the films that its made, have not always been seen as pertinent. The volume begins by reviewing and rethinking the concept of national cinema in an age of globalisation, and it goes on to chart the parallel developments of national film industries and the idea of a nation state in countries as diverse as Japan, South Korea, Russia, France and Italy. The issues of a &#39;national cinema&#39; for nation states of contested status, with disputed borders or displaced peoples, is discussed in relation to film-making in Taiwan, Ireland and Palestine. The contributors also consider the future of national cinema in an age of trans-national cultural flows, exploring issues of national identity and cinema in Latin America, Asia, the Middle-East, India, Africa and Europe. &#34;Theorising National Cinema&#34; also includes a valuable bibliography of works on national cinema.Valentina Vitali is Lecturer in Comparative Film and Media Studies and Paul Willemen is Professor of Film Studies at University of Ulster, Coleraine.</p><h2>Value at Risk: The New Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk</h2><p>To accommodate sweeping global economic changes, the risk management field has evolved substantially since the first edition of Value at Risk, making this revised edition a must. Updates include a new chapter on liquidity risk, information on the latest risk instruments and the expanded derivatives market, recent developments in Monte Carlo methods, and more. Value at Risk, Second Edition, will help professional risk managers understand, and operate within, today&#x2019;s dynamic new risk environment.</p><p>[BACK COVER] Value at Risk The Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk Second Edition Philippe Jorion [HEADLINE] Extensively Revised and Updated&#x2014;Philippe Jorion&#x2019;s Comprehensive Reference on Financial Risk Management [SUBHEAD] Praise for Value at Risk, Second Edition: "This book has become an industry standard for value at risk." &#x2014;Leslie Rahl, President Capital Markets Risk Advisors "Professor Jorion has succeeded in producing a great second edition. The book excels in explaining a complex subject with amazing clarity and depth. I recommend it highly to the novice as well as the practitioner and regulator of financial risk management. The theory is presented in plain language and brilliantly interspersed with examples of how the craft evolved&#x2014;as well as accidents and what can be learned from them. A &#x2018;must read.&#x2019;" &#x2014;Till Guldimann, Senior Vice President SunGard Trading and Risk Systems "Many books on VaR can be intimidating. Philippe Jorion offers a pragmatic and readable guide that covers the basics as well as recent best practice. A good primer, but also a good review of the state of the art." &#x2014;Leo de Bever, Vice-President, Research and Economics Ontario Teachers&#x2019; Pension Plan Board In 1996, the first edition of Philippe Jorion&#x2019;s Value at Risk gave financial professionals worldwide the first comprehensive description of value at risk (VAR). Now, to keep pace with sweeping changes and advances in the field of risk management, Jorion updates this state-of-the-art reference with new information on: � Latest risk management methods including backtesting, liquidity risk, and stress-testing � Techniques for understanding&#x2014;and working within&#x2014;today&#x2019;s new environment of integrated risk management, including market, credit, and operational risk � Strategic application of RAROC methods and VAR investment management systems [FLAP COPY] Value at Risk The Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk Second Edition Philippe Jorion Even as risk management assumes an increasingly central role in financial institutions, the actual understanding of financial risk continues to be problematic. Financial disasters still occur&#x2014;witness Asia&#x2019;s 1997 market turmoil, Russia&#x2019;s 1998 default, and the near-collapse of Long Term Capital Management&#x2014;as institutions either fail to see or, in some cases, completely ignore easily recognizable hallmarks of impending financial disaster. For financial risk managers attempting to navigate this tumultuous, rapidly changing environment, the updated, expanded, and substantially revised Value at Risk, second edition, will clarify the latest advances in risk management. The book&#x2019;s extensive restructuring, and broader scope, is reflected in its new subtitle. Whereas the first edition was described as "the new benchmark for controlling market risk," Value at Risk, second edition is now identified as "the benchmark for managing financial risk." With more than 200 pages of new material, the updated edition of this international bestseller (translated into Chinese, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish) provides financial professionals with the latest information they need to understand and implement value at risk&#x2014;and manage newer dimensions of financial risk. Initially confined to measuring market risk, VAR is now being used to actively control financial risk well beyond derivatives. Professionals can depend on this substantially new edition of Value at Risk for comprehensive, authoritative counsel and assistance in: � Measuring aggregate risk, and communicating a corporation&#x2019;s financial risks to both senior management and shareholders � Setting position limits, and creating a common denominator with which to compare risky activities in diverse markets � Allocating capital within an institution&#x2014;by adjusting returns for risk and implementing risk-adjusted performance measures (RAPM). As we move into the 21st century, the value at risk approach will continue to improve worldwide standards for managing numerous types of financial risk. Traders and financial risk managers; financial institution executives and supervisors; regulators; researchers ; and professors, graduate students, and others who need to know more about VAR, its application, and its results will get access to updated information and practices&#x2014;plus valuable data and guidance&#x2014;in Value at Risk, second edition.

(NATO Science Partnership Subseries: 3, 20)</h2><p>This book is the result of the contributions coming from the more than thirty key rd speakers of the 3 international Workshop on Nonlinear Microwave Magnetics held in th Roma, Italy from the 3rd to the 6 of October 1995. Since the 1990, in Ulyanovsk, when the Russian Academy of Sciences promoted the first Workshop of the series, the basic idea was to have a sort of Institutional Meeting collecting Scientists of the Magnetics Community devoted to Spin Wave Electronics at Microwave Frequencies. It was a succesful organization, and the birth of an effective interaction between eastern and western researchers overcame the meaning of the Workshop itself. Three years later, in Irvine, California, 1993, the Spin Wave Community was joined again. It was clear that the growing interest on hot topics of Nonlinear Microwave Magnetics involving both, applicative and fundamental aspects of microwave magnetic media, favoured the organization of further meetings on the same subject. So far, during the social dinner, in the middle between a serious proposal and the joke encouraged by the Californian Wine, Roma was proposed as the third place for the Workshop. Day after day, the joke became serious, and it was possible to solve the financial and logistic problems in time for the predicted deadline.</p><p></p><h2>Emergence: Contemporary Readings in Philosophy and Science (A Bradford Book)</h2><p><p><b>Contemporary classics on the the major approaches to emergence found in contemporary philosophy and science, with chapters by such prominent scholars as John Searle, Stephen Weinberg, William Wimsatt, Thomas Schelling, Jaegwon Kim, Daniel Dennett, Herbert Simon, Stephen Wolfram, Jerry Fodor, Philip Anderson, David Chalmers, and others.</b></p><p>Emergence, largely ignored just thirty years ago, has become one of the liveliest areas of research in both philosophy and science. Fueled by advances in complexity theory, artificial life, physics, psychology, sociology, and biology and by the parallel development of new conceptual tools in philosophy, the idea of emergence offers a way to understand a wide variety of complex phenomena in ways that are intriguingly different from more traditional approaches. This reader collects for the first time in one easily accessible place classic writings on emergence from contemporary philosophy and science. The chapters, by such prominent scholars as John Searle, Stephen Weinberg, William Wimsatt, Thomas Schelling, Jaegwon Kim, Robert Laughlin, Daniel Dennett, Herbert Simon, Stephen Wolfram, Jerry Fodor, Philip Anderson, and David Chalmers, cover the major approaches to emergence.

It examines the variety of ways the theatre's educational potential has been harnessed and theorised, the claims made for its value and the tension bettween theatre as education and theatre as 'art': between theatre's aesthetic dimenstion and the 'utilitarian' or 'instrumental' role for which it has so often been pressed into service.<br><br>Following a preliminary discussion of some key theoretical approaches to aesthetics, dramatic art and learning and, above all, the relationships between them, the study is organised into two broad chronological periods: early developments in European and American theatre up to the end of World War II, and participatory theatre and education since World War II. Within each period, a cluster of key themes is introduced and then re-visited and examined through a number of specific examples - seen within their cultural contexts - in subsequent chapters. Topics covered include an early use of theatre to campaign for prison reform; workers' theatre, agit-prop and American living newspapers in the 1930s; theatre's response to the dropping of the atom bomb in 1945; post-war theatre in education; theatre in prisons; and the use of performance in historic sites.</p><p>Anthony Jackson is Professor of Educational Theatre at the University of Manchester</p><h2>Chasing the Rabbit: How Market Leaders Outdistance the Competition and How Great Companies Can Catch Up and Win, Foreword by Clay Christensen</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the Shingo Prize for Research and Professional Publication, 2009</b> </p><p>How can companies perform so well that their industry counterparts are competitors in name only?

Carthaginians, Romans, vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, TUrks, French and Italians have all occupied the region in their time.<br>The Romans governed this part of Africa for six hundred cities, twelve thousand miles of roads and hundreds of aquaducts, some fifty miles long. The remains of many of these structures can be seen today.<br>At the height of its prosperity, during the second and third centuries AD, the area was the granary of Rome, and produced more olive oil than Italy itself.<br>The broadening horizons of the Roman Empire provided scope for the particular talents of a number of Africa's sons: the writers Terence and Apuleius; the first African Roman Emperor Septimius Severus, famous Christian theologians like Tertulllian and Saint Augustine - these are just some who rose to meet the challenges of their age.</p><p>Susan Raven is a professional journalist.<strong>This is the only account of Roman Africa in English that is both readable and reliable, and in the twenty years since its first publication it has established itself as the standard account.

Yet the technique is often met with alarm in the West and side-lined in favour of less controversial treatments such as fine-needle acupuncture, and moxibustion. This book provides a concise overview of its theory, historical and contemporary relevance, and clinical guidance. With detailed reference to the classic texts, the author clarifies the fundamental Chinese medical theory related to blood and the network vessels, and provides an in-depth discussion of the benefits of and practice guidelines for bloodletting. The book includes a chapter on the classical acupuncture techniques of Tung Ching Chang whose work is attracting increasing attention in the West. Through the exploration of classic texts and contemporary standards, the book provides everything needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the technique and to encourage its use as a viable treatment option in the West.</p><p>It will be an invaluable addition to the resources available for acupuncturists, as well as students and practitioners of Chinese medicine more generally, including those interested in all Chinese approaches to health.</p></p><p>This authoritative text explores the theory and function of bloodletting, and provides detailed instruction on its clinical useHenry McCann, DAOM, LAc, Dipl OM, is a licensed, professional practitioner of Chinese Medicine.

Wissler Professor of Physics at Middlebury College. He has published numerous educational texts and is widely known for his video course, <i>Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution</i>.Wolfson, a physics professor at Middlebury College, takes the fear out of Einstein's relativity theory in this brisk piece of pop science. The author uses a tennis game on Venus and a cup of hot tea to elucidate the basics of relativity, i.e., that the laws of physics are the same regardless of one's state of motion. Wolfson's economy and his handiness with hip, offbeat examples make this slim book a mind-bendingly satisfying read. The author's tutorial on the history of physics reminds readers that all the big names up to the late 19th century-Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, etc.-were concerned with the question of motion, whether of celestial bodies, falling apples or waves of light. He then shows why it required a genius like Einstein to arrive at such a simple idea as relativity. The most well-known and seemingly counterintuitive consequence of Einstein's thought, which Wolfson renders perfectly sensible, is the notion that space and time are not absolute but instead relative to one's frame of reference. The author then addresses the problem of gravity in Einstein's theory, which led the German scientist to develop his general theory of relativity. For readers, this means warped and rippling spacetime, black holes, and expanding and parallel universes. Wolfson's economical and vivid tutorial should open doors for lay readers encountering Einstein's principles for the first time. His popular style, with a minimum of math, should make this a must-have book for Einstein buffs as well. 48 illus.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide</h2><p>The best available textbook on the historical Jesus.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Stuttering: An Integrated Approach to Its Nature and Treatment (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p>This new Third Edition provides a comprehensive overview of the etiology and development of stuttering and details appropriate approaches to accurate assessment and treatment.

Jung, son of a Swiss Reformed pastor, used his Christian background throughout his career to illuminate the psychological roots of all religions. Jung believed religion was a profound, psychological response to the unknown--both the inner self and the outer worlds--and he understood Christianity to be a profound meditation on the meaning of the life of Jesus of Nazareth within the context of Hebrew spirituality and the Biblical worldview.</p><br><p> Murray Stein's introduction relates Jung's personal relationship with Christianity to his psychological views on religion in general, his hermeneutic of religious thought, and his therapeutic attitude toward Christianity. This volume includes extensive selections from Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity," "Christ as a Symbol of the Self," from <i>Aion,</i> "Answer to Job," letters to Father Vincent White from <i>Letters,</i> and many more.</p></p><p><p>"One thing above all should be stressed: Jung's ideas [about religion] are not the result of mere theory or of historical research--they have been wrested from the hard facts of his psychotherapeutic practice.... Jung is, by profession, a medical pastor of souls.... Thus, he not only possesses a very deep insight into the spiritual life of modern man; he also has to look round for what can help these sufferers."<b>--Hans Schaer, <i>Religion and the Cure of Souls in Jung's Psychology</i></b></p><p>"Stein provides a good selection of Jung's texts with a clear introduction to his Christian background and theory of Christianity."<b>--Diane Jonte-Pace</b></p><b>Murray Stein, Ph.D.,</b> is the author of <i>Jung's Treatment of Christianity, Practicing Wholeness, Transformation--Emergence of the Self,</i> and <i>Jung's Map of the Soul.</i> He is an international lecturer and teacher, and currently vice president of the International Association for Analytical Psychology.

The first two sections offer such items as the Slapping Gun and the Man Sling (in the section "Freedom of Action") to the scenarios that call for defensive measures such as the "Constellation of Jabs" and the visceral "Blow of Fatigue" (in the section "Apparitions"). Also included is one of Michaux's more complex fantastical-anthropological travelogues, "Portrait of the Meidosems," an account of the ways and manners of a population of vague ectoplasmic figures, anguished filaments of sorts that struggle to exist but are never allowed to sit still. This volume charts a turning point in Michaux's life and in the world, where his earlier depictions of visualized psychology and suffering found representation in a traumatized Europe. Imbued by the war years, the Occupation and the horror of the concentration camps, <i>Life in the Folds</i> bears the scars of Michaux's own personal catastrophe--the loss of his wife, who had died of "atrocious burns" the previous year--and concludes with the autobiographical text, "Old Age of Pollagoras," a wearied testament uttered before a haunted "plain of death."</p><p></p><h2>Muscle Disorders in Childhood</h2><p>This reference focuses on the clinical assessment, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of all forms of muscle diseases that affect children.

Their emphasis on dreams, automatic writing, and the unconscious reveal some of the least inhibited masculine fantasies. The first resistance to the male surrealists' projection of the female figure arose in the writings and paintings of marginalized woman artists and writers associated with Surrealism. The essays in this collection explore the complexity of these women's works, which simultaneously employ and subvert the dominant discourse of male surrealists.</p><p><b>Essays<br></b>What Do Little Girls Dream Of: The Insurgent Writing of Gis�le Prassinos � Finding What You Are Not Looking For � From D�jeuner en fourrure to Caroline: Meret Oppenheim's Chronicle of Surrealism � Speaking with Forked Tongues: "Male" Discourse in "Female" Surrealism? � Androgyny: Interview with Meret Oppenheim � The Body Subversive: Corporeal Imagery in Carrington, Prassinos, and Mansour � Identity Crises: Joyce Mansour's Narratives � Joyce Mansour and Egyptian Mythology � In the Interim: The Constructivist Surrealism of Kay Sage � The Flight from Passion in Leonora Carrington's Literary Work � Beauty and/Is the Beast: Animal Symbology in the Work of Leonora Carrington, Remedio Varo, and Leonor Fini � Valentine, Andr�, Paul et les autres, or the Surrealization of Valentine Hugo � Refashioning the World to the Image of Female Desire: The Collages of Aube Ell�ou�t � Eileen Agar � Statement by Dorothea Tanning</p></p><p>These sixteen essays present an important revision of surrealism by focusing on the works of women surrealists and their strategies to assert positions as creative subjects within a movement that regarded woman primarily as an object of masculine desire or fear.Mary Ann Caws, an art historian, literary critic, and translator, is Distinguished Professor of English, French, and Comparative Literature in the Graduate School of the City University of New York.

For outsiders, especially scientists who rely on physicist&#39;s theories in their own fields, this situation is disquieting. Moreover, many recall their introduction to quantum mechanics as a startling, if not shocking, experience. A molecular biologist related how he had started in theoretical physics but, after hearing the ideology of quantum mechanics, marched straight to the Reg� istrar&#39;s office and switched fields. A colleague recalled how her undergraduate chemistry professor religiously entertained queries from the class - until one day he began with the words: &#34;No questions will be permitted on today&#39;s lecture.&#34; The topic, of course, was quantum mechanics. My father, an organic chemist at a Midwestern university, also had to give that dreaded annual lecture. Around age 16, I picked up a little book he used to prepare and was perplexed by the author&#39;s tone, which seemed apologetic to the point of pleading. It was my first brush with the quantum theory. 6 Eventually, I went to graduate school in physics. By then I had acquired an historical bent, which developed out of an episode in my freshman year in college. To relieve the tedium of the introductory physics course, I set out to understand Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity (the so-called Special Theory of 1905, not the later and more difficult General Theory of 1915). This went badly at first.</p><p>David Wick has held academic positions at Princeton University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Colorado at Boulder. He currently works as a statistics consultant in biomedicine.This work starts with the development of quantum theory, which the author refers to as the history of an intellectual struggle, and leads up to the controversies surrounding it. In order to provide the complete picture, Wick, a mathematician by training, presents a brief biography and a synopsis of the philosophy of various scientists as they feature in this history. Wick keeps the equations to a minimum, writing in lay readers' terms, but includes a 52-page mathematical appendix by William G. Faris entitled "Probability in Quantum Mechanics." Extensive notes and references are included as well. Though it is very readable, this book is still complicated because of its technical subject matter, which gears it toward scientists and interested lay readers.

For individuals with an interest in physical geography.</p><h2>William Eggleston</h2><p>Born in 1939 in Memphis, Tennessee, where he currently resides, William Eggleston is considered one of America's most important photographers. His 1976 exhibition, <i>Photographs by William Eggleston</i>, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, marked a turning point in the history of photography: this was when color photography gained recognition as a medium of artistic expression. His intense and dramatic use of color and "democratic" approach to mundane subject matter continue to have an enormous impact on contemporary photographic practice. Published to accompany a French exhibition, this book brings together Eggleston's most significant works, from his first experiments in black-and-white to a series of photographs of Kyoto produced specifically for the exhibit. Drawing on public and private collections in Europe and the United States, the book includes vintage prints executed in the technique most characteristic of his work, the dye transfer process, as well as many lesser-known and previously unseen photographs. From Mississippi to Berlin, Kenya to Asia, Eggleston has tirelessly explored the wider world, transforming, through his camera, the ordinary into the extraordinary. Distributed on behalf of the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain. 160 color photographs.</p><p>Herve Chandes is director of the Fondation Cartier pour l&#39;art contemporain.Assembled by art critic Chandes, this volume was published to accompany a French exhibition of the work of American photographer William Eggleston. The photographs he produces sanctify the mundane while honoring and holding forever the inconsequential moment. This large, word-free collection contains some of his best old (1970s) and new photography. The idea that life, land, cars, small buildings, and clusters of people are assembled in bunches at random, in the accidental reality of a time and place, seen and framed and preserved by a photographer, helps all of us grasp the value of looking and trying to understand the world's visual chaos. When Eggleston photographs a '65 Buick that inexplicably ran up a concrete drainage wall only to be partially crushed and wedged under a highway overpass, we think, "That's amazing." But his expanded photo of the wreck through a wide-angle lens shows nearby bell-bottomed onlookers placed in no order with no apparent purpose but detached from the wreck by the onset of the immediate boredom common to the ordinary moment. Eggleston is the master of the moment. The only complaint here is that every one of the 146 photographs reproduced is titled Untitled. We need to know the words the photographer attaches to some of these preserved situations.

The poem takes the form of a detailed exposition of Epicurean physical theory - an extreme materialism designed to remove and discredit popular fears of the gods, death and an afterlife. Book III is generally accepted to be the finest in the whole poem; Lucretius argues there that the soul is as mortal as the body and shows that human response to the fact of mortality and death can be at once rational, dignified and liberating. Professor Kenney&#39;s commentary is the first to give proper critical emphasis to the techniques and intentions of Lucretius&#39; poetry; it can be read with profit by all students of Latin from senior school level upwards.</p><p>The De Rerum Natura of Lucretius is a sustained and impassioned protest against religious superstition and irrationality. The poem takes the form of a detailed exposition of Epicurean physical theory - an extreme materialism designed to remove and discredit popular fears of the gods, death and an afterlife.'This is a thoroughly professional commentary, long overdue, certainly the soundest available guide for anyone beginning to read Lucretius, and all written with a brevity that comes near to wit.'

Reductionism, however, has been widely resisted by both nonmolecular biologists and scientists working outside the field of biology. Many of these antireductionists, nevertheless, embrace the notion of physicalism&#x2014;the idea that all biological processes are physical in nature. How, Alexander Rosenberg asks, can these self-proclaimed physicalists also be antireductionists? <br><br>With clarity and wit, <i>Darwinian Reductionism</i> navigates this difficult and seemingly intractable dualism with convincing analysis and timely evidence. In the spirit of the few distinguished biologists who accept reductionism&#x2014;E. O. Wilson, Francis Crick, Jacques Monod, James Watson, and Richard Dawkins&#x2014;Rosenberg provides a philosophically sophisticated defense of reductionism and applies it to molecular developmental biology and the theory of natural selection, ultimately proving that the physicalist must also be a reductionist.<br><br></p><p><p><b>Alex Rosenberg</b> is the R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy and Biology at Duke University and the author of many books, including <i>Economics&#x2014;Mathematical Politics or Science of Diminishing Returns? </i>and <i>Instrumental Biology, or The Disunity of Science</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>&#x201c;For most philosophers, reductionism is wrong because it denies the fact of multiple realizability.&nbsp;For most biologists, reductionism is wrong because it involves a commitment to genetic determinism.&nbsp;In this stimulating new book, Rosenberg reconfigures the problem.&nbsp;His Darwinian reductionism denies genetic determinism and it has no problem with multiple realizability.&nbsp;It captures what scientific materialism should have been after all along.&#x201d; (Elliot Sober, University of Wisconsin)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Over the last twenty years and more,&nbsp;philosophers and theoretical biologists have built an antireductionist consensus about biology. We have thought that biology is autonomous without being spooky. While biological systems are built from chemical ones, biological facts are not just physical facts, and biological explanations cannot be replaced by physical and chemical ones. The most consistent, articulate, informed, and lucid skeptic about this view has been Alex Rosenberg, and <i>Darwinian Reductionism</i> is the mature synthesis of his alternative vision. He argues that we can show the paradigm facts of biology&#x2014;evolution and development&#x2014;are built from the chemical and physical, and reduce to them. Moreover, he argues, unpleasantly plausibly, that defenders of the consensus must slip one way or the other: into spookiness about the biological, or into a reduction program for the biological. People like me have no middle way. Bugger.&#x201d;</p> (Kim Sterelny, author of Sex and Death)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Alex Rosenberg has been thinking about reductionism in biology for a quarter of a century. His latest discussion is many-sided, informed, and informative&#x2014;and extremely challenging.&#x201d;</p> (Philip Kitcher, Columbia University)<br><br>"Rosenberg provides an accessible review of current ideas on the 'wiring' of . . . gene complexes and why they help account for morphological evolution. He is one of the first philosophers to conside the implications of 'evo-devo' . . . and seizes the opportunity to promote a reductionist interpretation that was simply not possible with population genetics."

This book treats the archaeology of Cyprus from the first-known human presence during the Late Epipalaeolithic (ca. 11,000 BC) through the end of the Bronze Age (ca. 1000 BC). A. Bernard Knapp examines the archaeological and documentary records of prehistoric Cyprus within their regional context, paying special attention to the Levant and the Aegean. The appendix (compiled by Sturt W. Manning) analyses all published radiocarbon dates from the island, providing for the first time a comprehensive chronological framework for all of Cypriot prehistory. Focusing on key themes such as identity, insularity and connectivity, and society, community and polity throughout, this book provides a remarkably up-to-date and integrated synthesis of human activity on the Mediterranean&#39;s third-largest island.</p><p>A.

Assembled by two esteemed scholars in black theater, Harry J. Elam, Jr. and David Krasner, and composed of essays from acknowledged authorities in the field, this anthology is organized into four sections representative of the ways black theater, drama, and performance interact and enact continual social, cultural, and political dialogues.<br> <br>Ranging from a discussion of dramatic performances of <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> to the Black Art Movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, articles gathered in the first section, "Social Protest and the Politics of Representation," discuss the ways in which African American theater and performance have operated as social weapons and tools of protest. The second section of the volume, "Cultural Traditions, Cultural Memory and Performance," features, among other essays, Joseph Roach's chronicle of the slave performances at Congo Square in New Orleans and Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s critique of August Wilson's cultural polemics. "Intersections of Race and Gender," the third section, includes analyses of the intersections of race and gender on the minstrel stage, the plight of black female choreographers at the inception of Modern Dance, and contemporary representations of black homosexuality by PomoAfro Homo. Using theories of performance and performativity, articles in the fourth section, "African American Performativity and the Performance of Race," probe into the ways blackness and racial identity have been constructed in and through performance. The final section is a round-table assessment of the past and present state of African American Theater and Performance Studies by some of the leading senior scholars in the field--James V. Hatch, Sandra L. Richards, and Margaret B. Wilkerson. <br> <br>Revealing the dynamic relationship between race and theater, this volume illustrates how the social and historical contexts of production critically affect theatrical performances of blackness and their meanings and, at the same time, how African American cultural, social, and political struggles have been profoundly affected by theatrical representations and performances. This one-volume collection is sure to become an important reference for those studying black theater and an engrossing survey for all readers of African American literature.<br></p><p><br>Harry J.

Although various diseases are touched on, cancer?especially as it affects women?is Bolen's focus. Yet far from being a grim tract, this book is a kind of metaphysical how-to filled with hope, second chances and sound guidance. But from the very first "initiation story" the author narrates for us?the myth of the abduction to the underworld of Persephone, an ancient Greek emblem of spring, vitality, rebirth?Bolen makes clear that there are dark and dangerous realms to traverse to learn how to help make oneself well and whole again. In her view, there is no mind/body split, no dichotomy between psyche and soma: the mind is everywhere in the body and affects physiological outcomes. While the book's Jungian tone will keep some readers away (even as it attracts others), and while it's not full of original ideas, it is a skillful assemblage of views on the harrowing experience of physical illness and mental dissociation from which we can and may emerge with a new clarity about who we are and what we want our lives to be. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stanislavski in Rehearsal : The Final Years</h2><p>Jean Benedetti&#39;s new translation of Toporkov&#39;s invaluable record restores to us the vitality and insight of Stanislavski&#39;s mature thoughts on acting.

A genius of social satire delivered with a very dry wit, Powell builds his comedies on the foibles of British high society between the wars, delving into subjects as various as psychoanalysis, the film industry, publishing, and (of course) sex. More explorations of relationships and vanity than plot-driven narratives, these slim novels reveal the early stirrings of the unequaled style, ear for dialogue, and eye for irony that would reach their caustic peak in Powell&#x2019;s epic <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i>.<br> <br> In <i>What&#x2019;s Become of Waring</i>, Powell lampoons a world with which he was intimately acquainted: the inner workings of a small London publisher. But even as Powell eviscerates the publishers&#x2019; less than scrupulous plotting in his tale of wild coincidences, mistaken identity, and romance, he never strays to the far side of farce. <br> <br> Written from a vantage point both high and necessarily narrow, Powell&#x2019;s early novels nevertheless deal in the universal themes that would become a substantial part of his oeuvre: pride, greed, and what makes people behave as they do. Filled with eccentric characters and piercing insights, Powell&#x2019;s work is achingly hilarious, human, and true.</p></p><p><b>Anthony Powell </b>(1905-2000) was an English novelist best known for <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i>, which was published in twelve volumes between 1951 and 1975. He also wrote seven other novels, a biography of John Aubrey, two plays, and three volumes of collected reviews and essays, as well as a four-volume autobiography, an abridged version of which, <i>To Keep the&nbsp;Ball&nbsp;Rolling</i>, is available from the&nbsp;University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;The quest for the historical Waring becomes the wildly entangled pursuit and exposure of a literary charlatan, and involves a gallery of British comic types. . . .

With this edition, the authors seek to answer two central questions, "How does the planet work?" and "Why is this important to know?" By discussing the unifying theory of plate tectonics in detail early in the text, the authors are able to link diverse material by this common thread, providing a global perspective of Earth and allowing students to recognize seemingly unrelated geologic phenomena as a continuum of interrelated events within a complete planetary system. In addition to providing students with an understanding of geology and its processes, the authors consistently demonstrate how geology relates to the human experience. By asking the question "What would you do?" throughout the text, students are encouraged to explore their reactions to particular situations. New "Geology in Your Life" sections address relevant student concerns, particularly in the areas of environment and energy. And a new penultimate chapter on Resources and the Fate of the Earth ties together many of the concepts of particular interest to students. This edition is fully integrated with the online student tutorial system Physical GeologyNow&#x2122;. Physical GeologyNow uses a series of chapter-specific diagnostic tests to build a personalized learning plan for each student, allowing students to focus their study time on specific areas of weaknesses. Each personalized learning plan directs students to specific chapter sections and concept-driven multimedia tutorials designed to augment their understanding.</p><p>James S.

Sex and food are intimately intertwined, and this relationship is nowhere more evident than among the plants that sustain us. From lascivious legumes to horny hot peppers, most of humanity&#x2019;s calories and other nutrition come from seeds and fruits&#x2014;the products of sex&#x2014;or from flowers, the organs that make plant sex possible. Sex has also played an arm&#x2019;s-length role in delivering plant food to our stomachs, as human handmade evolution (plant breeding, or artificial selection) has turned wild species into domesticated staples.<br><br>In <i>Sex on the Kitchen Table, </i>Norman C. Ellstrand takes us on a vegetable-laced tour of this entire sexual adventure. Starting with the love apple (otherwise known as the tomato) as a platform for understanding the kaleidoscopic ways that plants can engage in sex, successive chapters explore the sex lives of a range of food crops, including bananas, avocados, and beets, finally ending with genetically engineered squash&#x2014;a controversial, virus-resistant vegetable created by a process that involves the most ancient form of sex. Peppered throughout are original illustrations and delicious recipes, from sweet and savory tomato pudding to banana puffed pancakes, avocado toast (of course), and both transgenic and non-GMO tacos.<br><br>An eye-opening medley of serious science, culinary delights, and humor,<i> Sex on the Kitchen Table </i>offers new insight into fornicating flowers, salacious squash, and what we owe to them. So as we sit down to dine and ready for that first bite, let us say a special grace for our vegetal vittles: let&#x2019;s thank sex for getting them to our kitchen table.</p><p><b>Norman C. Ellstrand</b> is distinguished professor of genetics at the University of California, Riverside, where he holds the Jane S. Johnson Endowed Chair in Food and Agriculture. He is the author of <i>Dangerous Liaisons?: When Cultivated Plants Mate with Their Wild Relatives</i>."The sex life of an avocado might seem anything but lurid. Geneticist Ellstrand, however, reveals it as a riot of romantic yearning and &#x2018;sex switching.&#x2019; In his foray into the nexus of food, science, and plant reproduction, we enter that alternative universe in which olives and quinces are really vehicles for seeds, the tomato (the &#x2018;love apple&#x2019; of yore) is self-fertile, and cultivated bananas are female-sterile. You&#x2019;ll become reacquainted with the pistil, and wonder at the sugar beet&#x2019;s rise 'from a cascade of geopolitical incidents.' Nutrition might never seem the same again." (Barbara Kiser <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"Readers of <i>Sex on the Kitchen Table</i> will certainly learn more about tomatoes, bananas, avocados, beets, and squash, including the reproductive techniques of each. The discussion on human intervention and the banana is particularly interesting, blending science, politics, business, and sex.

Ellstrand reminds us that 'a lasting romance comes from understanding,' and in this book, he welcomes readers to develop a deeper understanding of the romance of plants and, therefore, of the meals we eat." (Jenny Ferguson <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;As his own research focus, Ellstrand is deeply familiar with the topic of gene flow in plants. Thus, he is able to extend each of his stories all the way from well-known basics to the latest research&#x2014;with references to papers from mid-2017&#x2014;that will bring surprising twists even to readers familiar with crop domestication and plant reproductive biology.&#x201d; (Susanne S.

(<i>Science News</i>)<br><br>"This book will not only change your perspective on tomatoes, bananas, avocados, beets, and squash, but it will also morph your view of vegetables into the erotic plants that they truly are, opening your eyes to observe the nature around you as perhaps a bit spicier." (Khue Tran <i>Yale Scientific</i>)<br><br>"A great little book that delivers on its promise of sex, sex and more sex. Although the sex is of the plant kind, that process has been crucial to the civilizing, and is essential for the continued survival, of the human race; plant sex is therefore of relevance and interest to us all." (Nigel Chaffey <i>Botany One</i>)<br><br>"My favorite science book of 2018 is <i>Sex on the Kitchen Table</i>, by Norman Ellstrand. This book shares the secret sex lives of our favorite fruits and veggies. For example did you know tomato farmers use special vibrators to help their plants reproduce? And bananas have been bred to not have sex at all. You learn that plants reproduce in all kinds of weird and wonderful ways and how important these different kinds of plant sex are to our food supply." (<i>Science Friday, Listeners' Best Books of 2018</i>)<br><br>"The sex in this self-proclaimed 'foodie sex manual' is all of the plant variety. But what a variety it is! . . . If plants could read, Ellstrand would be the ideal advice columnist&#x2014;his knowledge of the pleasures and perils of plant sex is prodigious, and his wit sparkles throughout." (Laurence Marschall <i>Natural History</i>)<br><br>"With a rare combination of irreverence and erudition, Ellstrand dives gleefully into the racier aspects of botanical reproduction. His focus on common food plants, complete with recipes, makes <i>Sex on the Kitchen Table</i> relatable, intriguing, and downright fun, while his deep knowledge and a lucid chapter on genetic modification give the book heft. A highly readable reminder that our deepest insights into nature often come from what we eat." (Thor Hanson, author of "Buzz" and "The Triumph of Seeds")<br><br>&#x201c;If the title of this book calls to mind the film encounter between Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, you should know that the scene had many botanical predecessors. Daily you may grace your kitchen table with the products of plant sex: avocados, tomatoes, and squash betray this origin in the seeds they contain, but a cabbage has a sex life too. Ellstrand shines a spotlight on plant sex, revealing how weird it can be, how promiscuous it often is, and just how mobile plant genes are. All our food plants have wild ancestors, and where wild and crop relatives grow near each other, sex happens. It takes engineering to move genes between unrelated species, but, Ellstrand argues, it&#x2019;s sex all the same. His message is wise-up and enjoy plant sex.

Battling against tyranny, ignorance, and superstition, it formulated the ideals of thought, religion, and expression, the value of science, and the pursuit of progress. Enlightenment thinkers undermined the <i>ancien regime</i> and provided the ideas for the French Revolution. Modern scholarship, however, has shown it was a more complex and ambiguous movement than commonly recognized. This book, now in a fully updated second edition, sympathetically explores the complexities of the Enlightenment.

The introduction explores the play&#39;s historical background and its relationship to the early cycle of history plays. The commentary examines in depth the play&#39;s linguistic and poetical features, while an extensive appendix on the use of sources explains the stages of its composition.William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) &#x2013; 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some the best work produced in these genres even today. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time." Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century.</p><h2>20th Century Selected Poems</h2><p>Rudyard Kipling&#39;s reputation as Britain&#39;s unofficial Poet Laureate has obscured the true nature of his achievement. Far from being an Establishment figure, he was a fiercely independent poet, opposed to the dominant political and literary leanings of his age. His poems range from exhilarating celebrations of British expansion, through vivid character sketches of soldiers and seamen, to political invective, artistic manifestos, and enchanting poems for children. In this new selection, Kipling&#39;s poems are presented in chronological order to reveal the scope and development, as well as the originality, of his work. Opening with Kipling&#39;s satirization of the British in India, it closes with his warning against the rise of Nazi Germany.</p><p></p><h2>People Want</h2><p>&#x201c;The people want . . .&#x201d;: This first half of slogans chanted by millions of Arab protesters since 2011 revealed a long-repressed craving for democracy. But huge social and economic problems were also laid bare by the protestors&#x2019; demands. <br><br>Simplistic interpretations of the uprising that has been shaking the Arab world since a young street vendor set himself on fire in Central Tunisia, on 17 December 2010, seek to portray it as purely political, or explain it by culture, age, religion, if not conspiracy theories. Instead, Gilbert Achcar locates the deep roots of the upheaval in the specific economic features that hamper the region&#x2019;s development and lead to dramatic social consequences, including massive youth unemployment. Intertwined with despotism, nepotism, and corruption, these features, produced an explosive situation that was aggravated by post-9/11 U.S. policies. The sponsoring of the Muslim Brotherhood by the Emirate of Qatar and its influential satellite channel, Al Jazeera, contributed to shaping the prelude to the uprising. But the explosion&#x2019;s deep roots, asserts Achcar, mean that what happened until now is but the beginning of a revolutionary process likely to extend for many more years to come.<br><br>The author identifies the actors and dynamics of the revolutionary process: the role of various social and political movements, the emergence of young actors making intensive use of new information and communication technologies, and the nature of power elites and existing state apparatuses that determine different conditions for regime overthrow in each case. Drawing a balance-sheet of the uprising in the countries that have been most affected by it until now, i.e. Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Syria, Achcar sheds special light on the nature and role of the movements that use Islam as a political banner. He scrutinizes attempts at co-opting the uprising by these movements and by the oil monarchies that sponsor them, as well as by the protector of these same monarchies: the U.S. government. Underlining the limitations of the &#x201c;Islamic Tsunami&#x201d; that some have used as a pretext to denigrate the whole uprising, Gilbert Achcar points to the requirements for a lasting solution to the social crisis and the contours of a progressive political alternative.<br><br></p><p>"One of the best analysts of the contemporary Arab world" &#x2015;<i>Le Monde</i><b>Gilbert Achcar </b>is Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS, University of London).

Reissued with a fresh Introduction by the Nobel-prize winner Paul Krugman and a new Afterword by Keynes&#x2019; biographer Robert Skidelsky, this important work is made available to a new generation.</p> <p><i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i> transformed economics and changed the face of modern macroeconomics.

It is situated in the southern part of Europe, cut off from the rest of the continent by a chain of high mountains which form a great wall on the north. It is surrounded on nearly all sides by the blue waters of the Med-it-er-rane-an Sea, which stretch so far inland that it is said no part of the country is forty miles from the sea, or ten miles from the hills. Thus shut in by sea and mountains, it forms a little territory by itself, and it was the home of a noted people. The history of Greece goes back to the time when people did not know how to write, and kept no record of what was happening around them. For a long while the stories told by parents to their children were the only information which could be had about the country and its former inhabitants; and these stories, slightly changed by every new teller, grew more and more extraordinary as time passed. At last they were so changed that no one could tell where the truth ended and fancy began.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Linguistics Delusion</h2><p>Linguistics is a subject which came to the fore only in the 1960s. It is founded on a fallacy. Linguistics claims to be &#39;the scientific study of language, &#39; but language behaviour is too open-ended and creative to be treated by the methods of science. In consequence, linguistic theories systematically distort the nature of language, and present a misleading picture of our human nature. Geoffrey Sampson shows how various traditions of linguistics, and their accounts of different aspects of language, are all infected by the delusion of scientism. And he offers positive examples of how language can be studied insightfully, once the scientistic delusion is given up</p><p>Geoffrey Sampson is Professor Emeritus at Sussex University and has taught linguistics at the LSE, Lancaster and Leeds Universities.

It all started with the research for my second novel, The Lights of Tenth Street. One of my main characters was a devoted husband and father. Because I had to put thoughts in his head, but had no idea what a guy would be thinking in a given situation, I interviewed my husband, Jeff, and many other male friends and colleagues. (&#x201c;What would you be thinking if you were the character in this scene?&#x201d;) It took me a while to figure out how to handle what I found.<br><br>You see, in many cases, what I heard stunned me. Not just because what the men were thinking was so surprising but because it was so foundational. These weren&#x2019;t feelings that popped up every few months but were deep fundamental needs, fears, doubts, and thought patterns that occur in men every single day. It didn&#x2019;t matter whether the man I was talking to was old or young; what his racial or cultural background was; whether he was married or single, a churchgoer or an atheist, a corporate executive or a factory line worker&#x2014;I kept hearing similar things.<br><br>The character in my novel was a good guy who loved his wife and kids, was a devoted churchgoer and godly man, and a successful businessman. But he struggled with his thought life, especially the visual temptations that beckoned from every corner, from the secret traps of the Internet to the overt appeal of the miniskirt walking down the street. So, in short&#x2014;and this is what shocked me&#x2014;I discovered that instead of being unusual, my character was like almost every man on the planet. Including the faithful husbands I was interviewing.<br><br>That revelation led to a host of others, and following those trails led me to the thousands of personal and written interviews with men&#x2014;including several professional, nationally representative surveys&#x2014;that form the core of this book. I interviewed close friends over dinner and strangers in the grocery store, married fathers at church and the single student sitting next to me on the airplane. I talked to CEOs, attorneys, pastors, technology geeks, business managers, the security guard at Costco, and the guys behind the counter at Starbucks. I even interviewed a&nbsp; professional opera singer, a household-name movie star, and a former NFL offensive tackle with a Super Bowl ring.

But there are a few who look close to my age, including one girl with a big, easy smile that catches my eye. They wear jewel studs in their ears, gemstones to remind them of family members or loved who they abandoned or who abandoned them when their eyes changed and it was clear that they were aki. Others wear coal where gemstones would go. Jewels for the living. Coal for the dead.</p><p>I grin as I watch that girl who smiled at me show off for her friends, doing a backflip off a piece of broken balcony. She sticks the landing, her tunic flipping up a bit to expose a patch of light-brown thigh. I catch a glimpse of a fresh black mark wrapped around her leg&#x2014;a tattoo of a snarling wolf.</p><p>Flashing another smile, Wolf Girl holds up her hand to get everyone&#x2019;s attention, and the aki form a circle.</p><p>They begin to clap, slowly and in unison, their bodies swaying with the rhythm. Arms wide, then clap. Arms wide, clap. Faster. Faster. Even faster.</p><p>Now the aki begin to stomp their feet in rhythm with each clap while they sing a familiar song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>One stone, two stone, three stone, four, </i></p><p><i>Sound of Arbaa aki knocking at your door.</i></p><p><i>One stone, two stone, three, four, five,</i></p><p><i>Khamsa dahia aki set your street on fire. </i></p><p><i>One stone, two stone, and one makes three,</i></p><p><i>Aki from Thalatha climbing up your trees.</i></p><p><i>One stone, one stone, one stone please,</i></p><p><i>So the pretty aki girl can then see me.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I mouth along, careful not to let out a sound. I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I joined a circle of young aki like this, but I haven&#x2019;t forgotten a single word.</p><p>As the last words of the song die down, one of the youngest kids enters the circle and bounces on his feet, twirls, till he&#x2019;s got everyone&#x2019;s attention. Then he really goes at it, bounding to the left of the circle, darting to the right. He spins. Flies through the air. And the little aki around him cheer and clap.</p><p>Another girl breaks away and dances toward him, clapping in his face. She matches him leap for leap, and now we have ourselves a fight. The two aki kick and dodge while the circle sings about the kid who steals the pearl and has to leave town, climbing over the massive Wall that surrounds our city of Kos and escaping into the forbidden forest on the other side to whoever is waiting to welcome him home.</p><p>I notice most of the aki, except for Wolf Girl, appear to have unmarked skin. But if I look closely, I can spot a small lizard tattooed along the collarbone. A griffin marking one&#x2019;s shoulder blades. Black ink on red skin, brown skin. Most of them are too young to have Eaten much sin, their skin largely unblemished by the animal markings earned by a successful sin-eating. The same markings that label us as pariahs, that earn us nasty looks and shoves in the Forum. These aki are lucky. I tug my sleeves down over my own arms and legs. They&#x2019;re covered with beasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could be inside sleeping like I deserve to, preparing for my next Eating, but it&#x2019;s nice out. Not so dry that the dust&#x2019;ll choke you into a coughing fit in two steps. And not so humid that the air feels heavy.</p><p>I even catch myself swinging my legs to the rhythm of the song as it echoes all the way up to where I&#x2019;m sitting. As I watch the aki laugh and dance, it&#x2019;s easy to forget that some of them are gonna get spit on as soon as they leave our dahia, our neighbor- hood, and walk through the Forum. Some of them are gonna get kicked, maybe even beaten by the Palace guards walking up and down our streets with their cutlasses and their gloves and their complete and total lack of humor. Here, they&#x2019;re happy and unbothered. Here,&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>are happy and unbothered.</p><p>A shadow passes over me.</p><p>I flinch, ready to strike, but it&#x2019;s just Bo.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>that, brother; I nearly dusted you,&#x201d; I huff.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m glad to see Bo, even though I know now it&#x2019;s just a matter of time before the other aki notice us. My friend is easily four or five hands taller than most people in the city of Kos. He&#x2019;s hard to miss.</p><p>I make room for him, sliding over so he can sit down, too. But Bo just stays standing, his freshly marked arms crossed over his large chest, face as blank and serene as always.</p><p>&#x201c;Taj, we&#x2019;ve been called to the Palace,&#x201d; Bo says, then clears his throat to make sure I&#x2019;m still listening instead of looking at Wolf Girl. I smirk. That means he noticed her, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Jai was called to Eat a sin. He failed.&#x201d;</p><p>My smile fades. &#x201c;So he has Crossed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Bo&#x2019;s voice is quiet but steady. &#x201c;The inisisa ate him. It&#x2019;s still loose. They need us to take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>I stand up and brush the dust off, ignoring the small shiver that creeps down my spine. I didn&#x2019;t know Jai well, but we&#x2019;d lift our chins in greeting any time we crossed paths. The aki respected him. And now he&#x2019;s dead. Worse than dead. Eaten.</p><p>Already, I&#x2019;m trying to size up the inisisa, the sin-beast, in my mind. How big is it? How fast?</p><p>I check to make sure my daga is snugly tucked into my armband, even though I know it&#x2019;s always there. First thing I do every morning is slip my knife into my armband. I&#x2019;d feel naked without it.</p><p>&#x201c;Is the Mage already here?&#x201d; Nobody makes it to the Palace grounds without an escort.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he&#x2019;s waiting.&#x201d; Bo lays a heavy hand on my shoulder as I pass him. &#x201c;Careful, Taj. Jai was good. The inisisa shouldn&#x2019;t have beaten him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did that ruby-licker Mage say how big the inisisa is?&#x201d; I try to shrug off Bo&#x2019;s grip.</p><p>Bo shakes his head. Apparently saying no would be too much effort.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t worry, brother.&#x201d; I pat Bo&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;If that inisisa even dreams about beating me, I&#x2019;ll wake it up and make it apologize.&#x201d;</p><p>I lift Bo&#x2019;s hand off my shoulder and continue making my way into the street, where I find a Mage in a black robe, waiting to take me to my next engagement.</p><p>As we make our way to the palace, I run my fingers through my nappy hair. It&#x2019;s starting to grow out, and I like the look, like a massive, cushioned helmet, but it takes way too much effort to maintain. I have to wash it right. And sometimes, when it gets hot and humid, my hair falls all the way down over my ears so I look like a donkey. I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t seem worth it. But when it&#x2019;s good and upright and all puffed out, I love it.</p><p><br>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hate when they keep me waiting. The more time I&#x2019;m left alone with my thoughts, the more the nerves start to get to me. I play with my daga, flipping it up and catching it again and again, careful to catch the handle and not the sharp tip. I try to keep from wondering what&#x2019;s waiting for me behind the closed doors.</p><p>I&#x2019;m sitting on a bench on an outdoor balcony, waiting to be called into the Palace where the royal family resides. Even the wealthiest folks can only afford to hire one of us aki to Eat their sins and absolve them maybe once, twice a month. The royal Kaya family calls an aki every few days. Here in Kos, the purest, those most free of sin, rule everything. For the Kayas to main- tain power, it&#x2019;s necessary for the royal family to absolve them- selves of every little sin, down to the last white lie. For being so supposedly pure of soul, our leaders sure keep us aki busy.</p><p>Outside the marble balustrade, there&#x2019;s green everywhere. Green grass that stretches on forever, a few trees, shrubbery that lines stone walkways that curve out on the Palace grounds. I&#x2019;m so used to the reds and browns and blacks of the Forum that the green almost seems too bright, hurting my eyes. Even the breeze that whistles through this entryway feels like a luxury. We barely get any wind down in the stifling heat of the Forum.</p><p>On the balcony, it&#x2019;s just me and some of the Palace guards. Their uniforms are decorated with the royal Kaya crest. The Kaya crest is supposed to be some sort of dragon, but to me, it&#x2019;s always looked like one of those pesky common lizards that are constantly scurrying over walls, popping up in bags of rice, and scaring children.</p><p>One of the Palace guards glares at me as I tap a rhythm on the marble floor with my foot. I hold his gaze and grin as wide as I can while twirling my knife around my fingers.</p><p>Finally, the door to my left opens and four Palace guards emerge, carrying what is unmistakably Jai&#x2019;s body wrapped in a blanket. His arm hangs over the side, and I can see the markings covering it. Lizards and sparrows tattooed on fingers, a dragon whose wings circle his wrist. For a second, I wonder if his unpurified spirit, his inyo, still walks the Palace halls, preventing him from entering into Infinity. Sins weigh us down, and if you carry them with you past death, the earth and the sky both will reject you. They say that&#x2019;s why the aki poison the ground where they are buried, so that nothing good grows where we&#x2019;re laid. I say plantain trees grow just fine over our dead bodies. Although I&#x2019;m not into all that superstitious lahala, the Palace still gives me the creeps, and I mutter a quick prayer to the Unnamed, hoping to send Jai&#x2019;s inyo on its way.</p><p>Before they put him in the ground, someone&#x2019;s gonna have to cut his throat. He&#x2019;s Crossed but not fully dead, the worst that could happen to us. It would be too cruel to bury him alive.</p><p>Jai had never mentioned family before, but I hope he has people, so that they don&#x2019;t just toss him in the shallow pits where they bury our sin-heavy bodies, far from the mines.</p><p>Even as I shift my glance away, I see that Jai&#x2019;s skin is blue beneath the tattoos. I know if I were to get up and look into the aki&#x2019;s face, I&#x2019;d see his eyes glazed over, the color of ice, so unlike their usual brown. The bright stones studding his left ear would be dull as coal now. His face would be frozen in the same expression as when the sin-beast consumed him, sucking out his spirit and leaving only his ruined body behind.</p><p>But I won&#x2019;t let myself look, not even to say goodbye to Jai, because that&#x2019;s how the fear sneaks in. As fast as a lizard scampering right into my ears, if I give it that opening. Then it nestles there and grows. It makes me dull and slow, and when it comes time to fight the sin-beast, I won&#x2019;t be able to move as fast as I need to. Maybe that&#x2019;s what happened to Jai. He let himself get scared.</p><p>I stare straight ahead as the Palace guards carry Jai&#x2019;s body out of sight. A Mage walks out in a dark robe, and I hide my surprise when I recognize Izu, the head Mage. Back in our slum, we aki joke and call him Big Chief behind his back, but he&#x2019;s stood in the street before with Palace guards while his men ripped us from our families or snuffed us out from our hiding places. Other Mages will call us out for jobs, but Izu is the only one I&#x2019;ve ever seen do the recruiting. Very dark coal burns in the chest of a man who can do that kind of work.</p><p>It&#x2019;s Mages who have the power to pull sins from people&#x2019;s bodies. The sins take the form of beasts, the inisisa, and the Mages then sit back while we aki risk our lives to kill those monsters.</p><p>Izu lifts his chin at me and jerks his head at the door. It&#x2019;s time.</p><p>I push myself to my feet and follow Izu as he leads me inside and down the corridor. The doors shut grandly behind us. Everything here needs that extra weight. There isn&#x2019;t a single gesture that isn&#x2019;t laced with self-importance.</p><p>My worn shoes track dirt onto the plush red carpet as we walk down an endless hallway. I begin to hear a faint clanging sound that grows steadily louder. By the time we round a corner, the sound is deafening. We approach a door that&#x2019;s nearly bent in half at the middle, bulging from something inside striking it repeatedly. Whatever&#x2019;s inside sounds big. And angry.</p><p>I shoulder past the two Palace guards standing at the door, backs as straight as their pikes. A smirk twists my lips when I see their hands trembling where they grip those staffs.</p><p>I close my eyes and steady my breathing. There&#x2019;s always the temptation to wonder whose sin I will Eat, whose guilt I&#x2019;ll be taking into my soul and onto my skin. But I can&#x2019;t think about that. Because then I&#x2019;ll start to think about smooth-skinned Kaya princesses and princes. And I&#x2019;ll start to think about how they get to walk around pure and bathed in light, while I have to slip through the muddy Forum, spat on and ridiculed for my markings, proof of crimes I didn&#x2019;t even commit.</p><p>But I can&#x2019;t let myself go there. Which is why I don&#x2019;t wonder anymore. I don&#x2019;t ask questions. I&#x2019;m just here to Eat and get paid.</p><p>Suddenly, the clanging noise stops. Izu is at my side, and I look to him for permission. He nods, green eyes glinting beneath his hood. The Palace guards step forward, open the door, and I launch myself into the room, brandishing my blade. I don&#x2019;t even hear the doors close behind me, because the sin- beast rears up and roars in my face.</p><p>I stare up at a massive lion, one of the biggest I&#x2019;ve seen. The inisisa is formed of shadows so dark that it seems to suck all the light out of the room, even taking the glow from the daga in my hand. Its claws, inky tendrils of black, click against the floor tiles as it settles back on its enormous haunches. Sin made into living, breathing flesh by dark magic.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see how long it takes for me to do what Jai couldn&#x2019;t. I shut my mind down so that it&#x2019;s just me and my body. No room for emotions, for anger or fear or even joy. The beast raises a massive paw and swipes at me.</p><p>I duck beneath the first swing. Another paw comes at me and I leap back, but not far enough. Its claws tear at my shirt, the shadows as sharp and lethal as any true claws.</p><p>I scramble backward onto the wreckage of what must have been a lavish bed, catching splinters of wood in my palms. The room is a mess. Rugs lie scattered over the floor. There are smears of nearly dried blood everywhere. I&#x2019;d like to think Jai put up a fight.</p><p>The beast rushes after me, and its paw comes up again. I hop just out of reach of its swipe, then launch myself at the beast. I land on its left shoulder and push myself upward so I can scramble onto its back. The lion roars, but I clamp my thighs on either side of its immense neck. It bucks once, twice, trying to throw me off. I plunge my daga into its neck.</p><p>The room shakes with the beast&#x2019;s scream, and it bucks again and again, but I hold on tight. I stab and stab and stab. Finally, its legs collapse beneath it, and the beast slumps to the ground. Breathing hard, I jump off its back.</p><p>Three and a half minutes.&nbsp;<i>Uhlah.&nbsp;</i>No record today.</p><p>I dust my hands o...</p></p><h2>Get Started in Latin Absolute Beginner Course: The essential introduction to reading, writing and understanding a new language (Teach Yourself Language)</h2><p>Get Started in Latin is the course to follow if you are taking your first steps in Latin, whether classical or medieval.

It is certainly the funniest. Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness.</p><p>Tom Jones isn&#39;t a bad guy, but boys just want to have fun. Nearly two and a half centuries after its publication, the adventures of the rambunctious and randy Tom Jones still makes for great reading.

This epic of everyday life chronicles the adventures of Tome Jones, who was abandoned as an infant and grows into a lusty, imprudent young man. Promising to mend his ways, Tom competes with his abusive rival for the affections of a wealthy squire's daughter, and learns the truth about his identity, in this discerning comedy of human foibles and self-discovery.</p><h2>Emergent Actors in World Politics</h2><p><p>The disappearance and formation of states and nations after the end of the Cold War have proved puzzling to both theorists and policymakers. Lars-Erik Cederman argues that this lack of conceptual preparation stems from two tendencies in conventional theorizing. First, the dominant focus on cohesive nation-states as the only actors of world politics obscures crucial differences between the state and the nation. Second, traditional theory usually treats these units as fixed. Cederman offers a fresh way of analyzing world politics: complex adaptive systems modeling. He provides a new series of models--not ones that rely on rational-choice, but rather computerized thought-experiments--that separate the state from the nation and incorporate these as emergent rather than preconceived actors. This theory of the emergent actor shifts attention away from the exclusively behavioral focus of conventional international relations theory toward a truly dynamic perspective that treats the actors of world politics as dependent rather than independent variables.</p><br><p> Cederman illustrates that while structural realist predictions about unit-level invariance hold up under certain circumstances, they are heavily dependent on fierce power competition, which can result in unipolarity instead of the balance of power. He provides a thorough examination of the processes of nationalist mobilization and coordination in multi-ethnic states. Cederman states that such states' efforts to instill loyalty in their ethnically diverse populations may backfire, and that, moreover, if the revolutionary movement is culturally split, its identity becomes more inclusive as the power gap in the imperial center's favor increases.</p></p><p><p>"This is an impressive and very original work, which takes up some of the most important and timely issues in the study of international relations and the emergence of nations and states. It opens up a very promising avenue for theoretical development by proposing a fresh solution to some of the basic epistemological problems of traditional positivistic studies of international relations."--<b>Jack L.

(true crime).</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2014:</strong> An epigraph from Patricia Highsmith&#x2019;s <em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em> says much about what&#x2019;s to come in Walter Kirn&#x2019;s remarkable confessional: &#x201c;He was versatile, and the world was wide!&#x201d; When Kirn first met Clark Rockefeller, he was smitten by the man&#x2019;s wealth and eccentricities. Coming off a failed marriage (to the daughter of Thomas McGuane and Margot Kidder), Kirn was a bit of a wreck, as was Rockefeller. The two men were drawn to each other. As the friendship progressed--into some uneasy terrain--Kirn ignored the clues &#x201c;spread out for [him] to read,&#x201d; and plowed ahead to become a confidant and enabler. Except, it turns out, Clark wasn&#x2019;t a Rockefeller at all. Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter was, as Kirn puts it, &#x201c;the most prodigious serial imposter in recent history.&#x201d; He was also a murderer. So what did that make Kirn? &#x201c;A fool,&#x201d; he admits, &#x201c;a stubborn fool.&#x201d; This is a compulsively readable, can&#x2019;t-look-away book and, ultimately, a brave piece of work. Kirn has laid himself bare: his failed marriage, his Ritalin reliance, his misguided allegiance to a sociopath. In exposing his own &#x201c;ignorance and vanity,&#x201d; what Kirn has really crafted here is the story of a bamboozled writer who for fifteen years ignored the big story right under his nose; who, in trusting his imposter friend, &#x201c;violated my storyteller&#x2019;s oath.&#x201d; With <em>Blood Will Out</em>, Kirn has impressively restored his storyteller&#x2019;s credentials. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p>Walter Kirn is the author of Thumbsucker and Up in the Air, both made into major films.

Defining culture and pinpointing its role in our lives is not, however, so straightforward. Terry Eagleton, one of our foremost literary and cultural critics, is uniquely poised to take on the challenge. In this keenly analytical and acerbically funny book, he explores how culture and our conceptualizations of it have evolved over the last two centuries&#x2014;from rarified sphere to humble practices, and from a bulwark against industrialism&#x2019;s encroaches to present-day capitalism&#x2019;s most profitable export. Ranging over art and literature as well as philosophy and anthropology, and major but somewhat "unfashionable" thinkers like Johann Gottfried Herder and Edmund Burke as well as T. S. Eliot, Matthew Arnold, Raymond Williams, and Oscar Wilde, Eagleton provides a cogent overview of culture set firmly in its historical and theoretical contexts, illuminating its collusion with colonialism, nationalism, the decline of religion, and the rise of and rule over the "uncultured" masses. Eagleton also examines culture today, lambasting the commodification and co-option of a force that, properly understood, is a vital means for us to cultivate and enrich our social lives, and can even provide the impetus to transform civil society.</p><p>This sweeping intellectual history explores how culture has changed and been understood over the last two hundred years, arguing against its increasing commodification today to reclaim its role in enriching our social lives.<b>Terry Eagleton</b> is distinguished professor of English literature, University of Lancaster.

North Carolinians of the nineteenth century dwelt in an agrarian world. It is the first volume in <i>The Way We Lived in North Carolina</i>, a pioneering series that uses historic places as windows to the past.<br><br>Even before Raleigh's "lost colony," Europeans had explored the coast and the mountains. the first permanent newcomers were English migrants from Virginia, followed after 1715 by planters and slaves from South Carolina. In the next half-century, thousands of German, Scotch-Irish, and Scottish settlers came by boat from Europe and by wagon from the North. Those who carved out farms in the piedmont had little in common with coastal planters or the backcountry elite of lawyers, judges, and merchants. By the late 1760s, western farmers organized as Regulators to protest unjust taxes, corrupt courts, and threats to private property -- issues that would soon reappear as part of the patriot rhetoric of the American Revolution.<br><br>Locations used to illuminate this early period range from the Town Creek Indian Mound to Governor Tryon's Palace. Sites include not only colonial plantations, churches, and forts, but also frontier cabins, wilderness parks, historic trails, and Indian settlements.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Can We Talk to God?</h2><p>Book offers framework for prayer that is compatihle with traditional religion and moves beyond to the recognition of a divine presence within each person.</p><p></p><h2>Rethinking the Developmental State: India&#39;s Industry in Comparative Perspective</h2><p><i>Rethinking the Developmental State</i> charts a promising new direction in political economy by detailing case studies of the relations between the state and industry. This book examines why the same state has intervened in three industries to wildly disparate levels of success. In India, the software industry has been a runaway success, the automobile industry has been moderately successful, and the steel industry has simply failed. Existing arguments about the developmental state primarily examine how a developmental state acts, not why it acts the way it does. Vibha Pingl� presents an argument about the kind of business-government relations that make a state willing and able to act in a manner beneficial to development, and what effect the differences in relations between bureaucrats and entrepreneurs have on emerging industries. Placing Indian industrial development in a comparative and theoretical context, this book extends our understanding about the process of industrialization in newly industrializing countries.<br></p><p><b>Vibha Pingit</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Rutgers University.<br></p><h2>The Talmud, Vol. 6: Tractate Bava Metzia, Part 6, Steinsaltz Editon (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>This volume of this monumental publishing venture concludes Tractate Bava Metzia, and continues a discussion of business ethics.</p><p>of this monumental publishing venture concludes Tractate Bava Metzia, and continues a discussion of business ethics.</p><h2>Toxic People: Decontaminate Difficult People at Work Without Using Weapons Or Duct Tape</h2><p>Praise For Toxic People &#34;From corporate America to the smallest business owner, this book should be mandatory reading because it provides toxic relief that will put money in your pocket and calm in your personality.

In this new book, Robert Siegler addresses these and other fundamental questions about children&#39;s thinking. Previous theories have tended to depict cognitive development much like a staircase. At an early age, children think in one way; as they get older, they step up to increasingly higher ways of thinking. Siegler proposes that viewing the development within an evolutionary framework is more useful than a staircase model. The evolution of species depends on mechanisms for generating variability, for choosing adaptively among the variants, and for preserving the lessons of past experience so that successful variants become increasingly prevalent. The development of children&#39;s thinking appears to depend on mechanisms to fulfill these same functions. Siegler&#39;s theory is consistent with a great deal of evidence. It unifies phenomena from such areas as problem solving, reasoning, and memory, and reveals commonalities in the thinking of people of all ages. Most important, it leads to valuable insights regarding a basic question about children&#39;s thinking asked by cognitive, developmental, and educational psychologists: How does change occur?</p><p>Robert S. Siegler, Professor of Psycholoy, Carnegie Mellon University.<br>"Siegler proposes a paradigmatic shift in the field of child development, away from the study of 'essences' and toward the study of change. . . . The results are intriguing and perhaps revolutionary--must-reading for professionals in the field of cognition."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"This is one of those rare books that promises to change the way that psychologists view the central problem of developmental psychology. . .Siegler provides a cogent and convincing argument that variability is a constant in thought at all levels and provides the key to cutting through to the problem of cognitive change. In addition to providing a wide range of examples showing the centrality of adaptive variability in children's thinking at all levels, Siegler describes a methodology for describing developmental change as it progresses. Few will be able to read it without considering how to apply this model and methods to their own domain of interest. This book will serve as a handbook for anyone who wants to take up the challenge of taking development seriously."--Kevin Miller, <em>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Emerging Minds</em>, Siegler designs a clear, thorough, and well-defined map for the new paradigm...Siegler shows the prevalence of variability and its eminent role in development. Other researchers adhering to process-oriented approaches also highlight the importance of variability, but Siegler's account is outstanding in its thoroughness and scope. Siegler reviews years of research, numerous domains of study, research done by him and many others, and populations involving the whole age range from infancy to adulthood. He shows that variability prevails not only between domains, as domain specificity advocates have claimed, but also within a domain (both across children and in a single child)...In addition, he provides the reader with an extensive set of future questions, outlines directions for further research within the new terrain, and designs a new agenda for cognitive development."--<em>Human Development</em><p></p><br>"Digital clocks are the reason that small children now say things that nobody else does, like 'it's 2:58' instead of 'it's 3 o'clock,' or 'it's 7:43' instead of 'it's time for bed.' They say those things because, thanks to digital clocks, a child who can read numerals can tell you what time it is. But, cautions Robert Seigler [i.e. Siegler], that's not the same thing as telling time. Telling time involves learning new concepts--the relationship between minutes and hours, the way that hours progress. That learning doesn't happen quickly or early and it probably doesn't happen with a digital clock. 'Typically, children first learn to tell the hours, then the half-hours,' said Seigler [sic], author of 'Emerging Minds' . . . and 'Children's Thinking' . . . He is a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 'That typically happens in second grade, and a lot of children are able to do that long before anything else. The quarter-hours come next.'"--<em>Deseret News</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Nicholas Roerich: The Life &amp; Art of a Russian Master</h2><p>Traces the life and career of the Russian artist, examines the motivating forces behind his art, and offers reproductions of his paintings of ancient Slavic and mythic subjects, Himalayan landscapes, and religious themes</p><p>This captivating biography illuminates the extraordinary life of a visionary artist, author, educator, archaeologist, explorer, philosopher, cultural humanitarian, and peacemaker. Decter's well-researched text brings Roerich to life by allowing us to rediscover this "forgotten renaissance man" whose belief in the harmonious integration of life and art led him to four continents and the promotion of an international treaty, the Roerich Peace Pact, which earned him a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1929. This pact stresses the importance of protecting the world's cultural legacy during war. The illustrations cover Roerich's entire career, from Slavic and mystic subjects to his notable Himalayan landscapes and spiritual themes. Also included are historic photographs that chronicle his expeditions to India and Central Asia. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

Responding to an era that has increasingly chosen to dub itself as &#39;post-internet&#39;, this collective text traces a potted narrative exploring the relationship of the Internet to art practices from the early millennium to the present day. The book positions itself as a provocation on the current state of cultural production, relying on first-person accounts from artists, writers and curators as the primary source material.

Geoffrey Wawro describes Prussia&#39;s successful invasion of Habsburg Bohemia, and the wretched collapse of the Austrian army in July 1866. Blending military and social history, he describes the panic that overtook Austria&#39;s regiments in each clash with the Prussians. He reveals the blundering of the Austrian commandant who fumbled away key strategic advantages and ultimately lost a war--crucial to the fortunes of the Habsburg Monarchy--that most European pundits had predicted they would win.</p><p>Geoffrey Wawro recounts the story of this crucial European war, from its diplomatic origins to its pivotal battles. This is the first history of the Austro-Prussian War in more than thirty years, and the first ever to be based upon extensive research in the political and military archives of Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and England. Wawro has reconstructed the Austrian campaign, blow-by-blow, hour-by-hour. He divulges the secrets of Prussian military success, as well as the dismal, sometimes lurid reasons for Austria&#39;s military collapse and Italy&#39;s near collapse. The book is most notable for the light it sheds on the Habsburg war effort."The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 started the modern Hundred Years' War that did not end until 1945. Professor Geoff Wawro's book is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject. Thoughtful and well written, it is a major contribution to an understanding of history."

Inspired by the Bourbaki seminar in mathematics in its organization, hence nicknamed &#x201c;Bourbaphi&#x201d;, the Poincar� e Seminar is held twice a year at the Institut Henri Poincar� e in Paris, with cont- butions prepared in advance. Particular care is devoted to the pedagogical nature of the presentations so as to ful?ll the goal of being readable by a large audience of scientists. This volume contains the seventh such Seminar, held in 2005. It is devoted to Einstein&#x2019;s 1905 papers and their legacy. After a presentation of Einstein&#x2019;s ep- temological approach to physics, and the genesis of special relativity, a cen- nary perspective is o?ered. The geometry of relativistic spacetime is explained in detail. Single photon experiments are presented, as a spectacular realization of Einstein&#x2019;s light quanta hypothesis. A previously unpublished lecture by Einstein, which presents an illuminating point of view on statistical physics in 1910, at the dawn of quantum mechanics, is reproduced. The volume ends with an essay on the historical, physical and mathematical aspects of Brownian motion. We hopethatthe publicationofthis serieswill servethe community ofphy- cists and mathematicians at the graduate student or professional level.</p><p><p>The Poincar� Seminar is held twice a year at the Institute Henri Poincar� in Paris.

He settled in Paris in 1937, after travels in Germany and periods of residence in London and Dublin. He remained in France during the Second World War and was active in the French Resistance. From the spring of 1946 his plays, novels, short fiction, poetry and criticism were largely written in French. With the production of En attendant Godot in Paris in 1953, Beckett&#39;s work began to achieve widespread recognition. During his subsequent career as a playwright and novelist in both French and English he redefined the possibilities of prose fiction and writing for the theatre. Samuel Beckett won the Prix Formentor in 1961 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. He died in Paris in December 1989.</p><h2>Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer Prevention and Treatment (Language of Science)</h2><p>The sixth annual research conference of the American Institute for Cancer Research was held August 31 and September 1, 1995, at the Loews L&#39;Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washing� ton, DC. In view of the promising leads in the diet/nutrition and cancer research field, the conference was devoted to &#34;Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer Prevention and Treatment. &#34; The number of sessions was increased over that in previous conferences in order to accommodate the topics of interest. The conference overview, entitled &#34;Plants and Cancer: Food, Fiber, and Phytochemicals,&#34; provided a framework for the following sessions. In addition, the attendees were reminded that for several decades epidemiologists have noted a lower risk of lung, esophageal, stomach, and colon cancer in populations consuming diets high in fruits and vegetables. However, isolation and ingestion of individual protective factors are not the preferred action since the complexity of the food and the matrix in which nutritional factors are embedded are important. The individual sessions then provided more insight as to why eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cancer.

It depicts the fractious instability of the court and nobility of fifteenth-century England, and their squabbles with their French counterparts.<br>Despite its debut performance in 1592, however, <em>Henry VI: Part One</em> does not appear in printed form until some thirty years later, in the 1623 folio. There are many questions, therefore, surrounding exactly how many people wrote the play, when they did so, how it was performed, who played what part, and the nature of the manuscript behind the first performance. In his wide-ranging introduction, Michael Taylor offers answers to these questions, and discusses other key issues such as language, structure, performance history, and the role of women in the play. Taylor edits the play for students, scholars, and theater-goers with an informative commentary on all aspects of the language, action, characters, and staging.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Does it arrive at your door on the back of an elephant? Can it float down the river to you? Or does it occupy a phone booth by the side of the road?<br><br> Public libraries are a cornerstone of modern civilization, yet like the books in them, libraries face an uncertain future in an increasingly digital world. Undaunted, librarians around the globe are thinking up astonishing ways of reaching those in reading need, whether by bike in Chicago, boat in Laos, or donkey in Colombia. <i>Improbable Libraries</i> showcases a wide range of unforgettable, never-before-seen images and interviews with librarians who are overcoming geographic, economic, and political difficulties to bring the written word to an eager audience. Alex Johnson charts the changing face of library architecture, as temporary pop-ups rub shoulders with monumental brick-and-mortar structures, and many libraries expand their mission to function as true community centers. To take just one example: the open-air Garden Library in Tel Aviv, located in a park near the city&#x2019;s main bus station, supports asylum seekers and migrant workers with a stock of 3,500 volumes in sixteen different languages. &nbsp;<br><br> Beautifully illustrated with two hundred and fifty color photographs, <i>Improbable Libraries</i> offers a breathtaking tour of the places that bring us together and provide education, entertainment, culture, and so much more.

As well as describing the circumstances in which Ravel composed, the book explores new evidence to present radical views of the composer&#x2019;s background and upbringing, his notorious failure in the Prix de Rome, his incisive and often combative character, his sexual preferences, and his long final illness. It also contains the most detailed account so far published of his hugely successful American tour of 1928.

And Bernard-Henri Levy shows how Sartre cannot be understood without taking into account his relations with the intellectual forebears and contemporaries, the lovers and friends, with whom he conducted a lifelong debate. His thinking was essentially a tumultuous dialogue with his whole age and himself. He learned from Gide the art of freedom, and how to experiment with inherited fictional forms. He was a fellow-traveller of communism, and yet his relations with the Party were deeply ambiguous. He was fascinated by Freud but trenchantly critical of psychoanalysis. Beneath Sartre&#39;s complex and ever-mutating political commitments, Levy detects a polarity between anarchic individualism on the one hand, and a longing for absolute community that brought him close to totalitarianism on the other. Levy depicts Sartre as a man who could succumb to the twentieth century&#39;s catastrophic attraction to violence and the false messianism of its total political solutions, while also being one of the fiercest critics of its illusions and shortcomings.</p><p>Bernard-Henri Levy is a philosopher and a writer.

The 2nd edition of the book is now available in paperback and eBook editions. See ISBN 978-0966377347. Introduction to Loudspeaker Design is written for hobbyists, technicians, and engineers seeking an introductory overview of the technology of loudspeakers. Starting with a brief history of audio developments the book begins by introducing the concepts of frequency, pitch, and loudness and proceeds to develop the idea of a loudspeaker as a system with performance that can be accurately predicted using simulation techniques not unlike those used to design electronic circuits. The work is largely qualitative with an occasional mathematical example. In addition to providing a clear discussion of closed and vented type loudspeaker enclosures the work also covers bandpass enclosures and includes a complete design example for a dipole loudspeaker. <p>The richly illustrated deluxe paperback edition also covers such advanced topics as loudspeaker design tradeoffs, spatial loading, diffraction loss, cavity effect, and enclosure construction. A complete chapter is devoted to the subject of crossover design. The appendices contain technical references, design aids, and charts summarizing the properties of 18 different loudspeaker enclosure types.</p></p><p>This work was begun in 1989 as part of the user's manual for my loudspeaker design software products. As I began talking with the users of these products I realized how difficult it was to locate introductory information on loudspeaker design. So I proceeded to expand my software manual to teach basic principles of audio and loudspeaker design. The work has now grown to the point where it can serve as an introduction to loudspeaker technology for hobbyists and engineers alike. <p>The design methods taught here follow the work of Neville Thiele and Dick Small. Ever since loudspeakers were first developed earlier this century to support the budding film industry the engineering analysis of loudspeaker enclosures was less than satisfactory until the publication of Neville Thiele's revolutionary work on loudspeakers in vented boxes in the 1970's. After Thiele's work was expanded and clarified by Dick Small the Thiele-Small Model for loudspeaker systems analysis finally emerged as a useful engineering design tool. </p><p>With the Thiele-Small method, the acoustic analysis of a loudspeaker enclosure was transformed and moved from the mysterious world of acoustics to the well-developed domain of electrical circuit analysis. Now, for the first time, we could create electrical circuit models that could predict the acoustic performance that would result when a given driver was mounted in a known enclosure. The implementation of Thiele-Small analysis on mainframe computers and hand-held calculators in the 1970's marked the beginning of the practice of loudspeaker design via simulation. </p><p>Today most loudspeaker design tasks are performed with the aid of a personal computer using a loudspeaker simulator such as my WinSpeakerz or MacSpeakerz applications. Therefore it should not come as a surprise that much of the discussion here will center on computer aided design methods.</p>John L. Murphy B.S., M.S., AES, IEEE, ASA <p>The author is a physicist with over 20 years experience in the research and development of audio products ranging from 24 channel recording consoles to the miniature electronics found in electric guitars and bass instruments. In addition to his many tube and solid-state electronics products he has also designed loudspeakers for the Pro Audio, Hi-Fi, Musical Instrument, and Auto Sound industries. </p><p>Captain Murphy served as a space systems software analyst for the US Air Force during his military career. More recently he has returned to software development to write applications for loudspeaker simulation. His WinSpeakerz and MacSpeakerz applications are now used widely throughout the audio industry as a tool for evaluating loudspeakers before they are built.</p></p><h2>War Stories: The Search for a Usable Past in the Federal Republic of Germany</h2><p>Robert G. Moeller powerfully conveys the complicated story of how West Germans recast the recent past after the Second World War. He rejects earlier characterizations of a postwar West Germany dominated by attitudes of "forgetting" or silence about the Nazi past. He instead demonstrates the "selective remembering" that took place among West Germans during the postwar years: in particular, they remembered crimes committed against Germans, crimes that&#x2015;according to some contemporary accounts&#x2015;were comparable to the crimes of Germans against Jews. Moeller draws on a wide range of U.S. and German government documents, political debates, film archives, letters, oral histories, and newspaper accounts.</p><p>"A brilliant analysis of the manner in which postwar Germany forged for itself a new identity on the basis of vivid yet selective memories of the past. Robert Moeller convincingly demonstrates that public preoccupation with the expulsion of Germans from the east and the fate of prisoners of war in the Soviet Union created a sense of German victimhood that facilitated overcoming past crimes by asserting an equivalence of suffering. This is the best analysis by far of the 'negative' elements in the reconstruction of German national identity. The book is an indispensable contribution to our understanding of German politics and culture from the fall of Nazism to the present day."&#x2015;Omer Bartov, author of <i>Mirrors of Destruction</i><br><br>"Required reading for anyone interested in how selective memory shapes national identity, Robert Moeller's <i>War Stories </i>provides a whole new reading of Germany's confrontation with its Nazi past from the fifties through the nineties. . . .

Martin Goldsmith, best known as the host of NPR's <i>Performance Today</i>, is the American-born son of two German-Jewish musicians who escaped the Holocaust. He anchors the Holocaust to the story of his own family, whom he never knew because most of them perished in Hitler's death camps. Goldsmith accompanies them through their lives in Nazi Germany, with its ever-tightening persecution and repression of the Jews, and on their nightmarish journey to the gas chambers. He follows his parents through their early musical training, their blossoming love, courtship, and marriage--making them seem like a normal, happy young couple--to their miraculous rescue and escape to America.<p> The book's linchpin is the Jewish Culture Association ("J�dische Kulturbund"), in whose Berlin orchestra his parents met. Established by prominent Jewish leaders in 1933, after a "purge" of all Jewish Civil Servants, the Kulturbund flourished for eight years, with the permission and under the constant, increasingly repressive surveillance of the Nazis, who exploited it as a propaganda tool. Spreading from Berlin to other cities, its musical and theatrical presentations, lectures, and films offered employment to thousands of Jewish artists and the only cultural oasis to its Jewish audiences. In 1941, Germany's preoccupation with the war and the "Final Solution" rendered it superfluous, and it was dissolved.</p><p> But Goldsmith also furnishes the proper historical context for his uniquely individual, human account of the 20th century's most inhuman period. After a chillingly detailed description of the grass-roots rise of Nazism, he focuses on particularly horrifying events: the infamous 1935 Nuremberg Laws and the devastating 1938 pogrom, "Kristallnacht." The tragedy of the 937 refugees, including Goldsmith's grandfather and uncle, who were refused disembarkation first in Cuba, then in Miami, illustrates the world's customary indifference to "other" people's misfortunes. Nobody paid attention when, as early as 1922, Hitler declared that his first priority on coming to power would be the extermination of the Jews.</p><p> Goldsmith's factual, reportorial style increases the sickening horror, and he reminds us frequently that he is writing about his own family. Though his story's outcome is never in doubt, he generates real suspense--a measure of his skill, despite his unfortunate habit of hinting at the future. The Kulturbund has been accused of encouraging the Jews to ignore the desperate circumstances outside the theater, and therefore the imminence of their danger. Goldsmith refutes this. For most of them, emigration was impossible because, apart from the natural fear of pulling up roots, leaving everything behind, and starting a new life, they had nowhere to go. Moreover, how could anyone foresee the depth of the impending horror? It was, and still is, beyond the human imagination.</p><p> Goldsmith writes with insight and aching honesty about the survivors' guilt and its numbing effect even upon the next generation. But his parents also taught him to love music and appreciate its meaning in people's lives, and he talks about it with real knowledge and understanding. (However, someone should have corrected his opening reference to Siegmund's sword in <i>Die Walk�re</i>, which is made of steel, not gold.) This is a brilliantly written, important, unforgettable book. <i>--Edith Eisler</i></p>Set amid the growing tyranny of Germany&#39;s Third Reich, here is the riveting and emotional tale of G?nther Goldschmidt and Rosemarie Gumpert, two courageous Jewish musicians who struggled to perform under unimaginable circumstances-and found themselves falling in love in a country bent on destroying them. In the spring of 1933, as the full weight of Germany&#39;s National Socialism was brought to bear against Germany&#39;s Jews, more than 8,000 Jewish musicians, actors, and other artists found themselves expelled from their positions with German orchestras, opera companies, and theater groups, and Jews were forbidden even to attend &#34;Aryan&#34; theaters. Later that year, the J?dische Kulturbund, or Jewish Culture Association, was created under the auspices of Joseph Goebbels&#39;s Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Providing for Jewish artists to perform for Jewish audiences, the Kulturbund, which included an orchestra, an opera company, and an acting troupe, became an unlikely haven for Jewish artists and offered much-needed spiritual enrichment for a besieged people-while at the same time providing the Nazis with a powerful propaganda tool for showing the rest of the world how well Jews were ostensibly being treated under the Third Reich. It was during this period that twenty-two-year-old flutist G?nther Goldschmidt was expelled from music school because of his Jewish roots. While preparing to flee the ever-tightening grip of Nazi Germany for Sweden, G?nther was invited to fill in for an ailing flutist with the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra. It was there, during rehearsals, that he met the dazzling nineteen-year-old violist Rosemarie Gumpert-a woman who would change the course of his life. Despite their strong attraction, G?nther eventually embarked for the safety of Sweden as planned, only to risk his life six months later returning to the woman he could not forget-and to the perilous country where hatred and brutality had begun to flourish. Here is G?nther and Rosemarie&#39;s story, a deeply moving tale of love and the remarkable resilience of the human spirit in the face of terror and persecution. Beautifully and simply told by their son, National Public Radio commentator Martin Goldsmith, The Inextinguishable Symphony takes us from the caf?s of Frankfurt, where Rosemarie and G?nther fell in love, to the concert halls that offered solace and hope for the beleaguered Jews, to the United States, where the two made a new life for themselves that would nevertheless remain shadowed by the fate of their families. Along with the fate of G?nther and Rosemarie&#39;s families, this rare memoir also illuminates the Kulturbund and the lives of other fascinating figures associated with it, including Kubu director Kurt Singer-a man so committed to the organization that he objected to his artists&#39; plans for flight, fearing that his productions would suffer. The Kubu, which included some of the most prominent artists of the day and young performers who would gain international fame after the war, became the sole source of culture and entertainment for Germany&#39;s Jews. A poignant testament to the enduring vitality of music and love even in the harshest times, The Inextinguishable Symphony gives us a compelling look at an important piece of Holocaust history that has heretofore gone largely untold.</p><h2>Torpor (Semiotext(e) / Native Agents)</h2><p><p>Sylvie wanted to believe that misery could simply be replaced with happiness. Time was a straight line, stretching out before you. If you could create a golden kind of time and lay it right beside the other time, the time of horror, Bad History could just recede into the distance without ever having to be resolved.--from TorporSet at the dawn of the New World Order, Chris Kraus's third novel, Torpor loops back to the beginning of the decade that was the basis of I Love Dick, her pseudo-confessional cult-classic debut. It's summer, 1991, post-MTV, pre-AOL. Jerome Shafir and Sylvie Green, two former New Yorkers who can no longer afford an East Village apartment, set off on a journey across the entire former Soviet Bloc with the specious aim of adopting a Romanian orphan. Nirvana's on the radio everywhere, and wars are erupting across Yugoslavia.Unhappily married to Jerome, a 53-year-old Columbia University professor who loathes academe, Sylvie thinks only of happiness. At 35, she dreams of stuffed bears and wonders why their lives lack the tremulous sincerity that pervades thirtysomething, that season's hot new TV show. There are only two things, Sylvie thinks, that will save them: a child of their own, and the success of The Anthropology of Unhappiness, her husband's long-postponed book on the Holocaust. But as they move forward toward impoverished Romania, Jerome's memories of his father's extermination at Auschwitz and his own childhood survival impede them.Savagely ironic and deeply lyrical, Torpor explores the swirling mix of nationalisms, capital flows and negative entropy that define the present, haunted by the persistence of historical memory. Written in the third person, it is her most personal novel to date.</p></p><p>&#34;Chris Kraus combines fiction, autobiography and criticism in ways that are as funny and provocative as her titles (Aliens and Anorexia, for example).&#34; --Los Angeles Times Book Review (this is a general Kraus plaudit, not Torpor-specific)The author of four novels, the most recent of which is <i>Summer of Hate</i>, and two books of criticism, Chris Kraus was recently described by the <i>New York Observer</i> as "the art world's favorite fiction writer."

Together they traveled through the western wilds of Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War, fought in the colony's fractious political battles. Ben helped his son attain the post of Royal Governor of New Jersey, and William's government hired Ben to represent the colony in London. But when war came, father and son were split: one acclaimed as a patriot hero, the other a loyalist condemned by his countrymen.<br> In <em>William Franklin</em>, Sheila Skemp tells the story of this fascinating and complex man, a man with a foot in both worlds--he loved both King and country, and saw the interests of both as inextricably intertwined. She follows William's early years as a militia officer in the wars with the French, his life as a law student in England, and his long tenure as Royal Governor of New Jersey. Skemp highlights the close personal and political relationship between father and son, depicting such ironic episodes as William's defense of his father against charges that Ben was the author of the infamous Stamp Act. But as the years passed, Ben, in London, grew increasingly bitter toward the Crown, while William, in America, remained devoted to the King. By the time war came, their loyalties were divided, their relationship destroyed.<br> Skemp traces William's career through the tumult of revolution and exile. Refusing to follow his fellow royal governors into asylum, he was arrested by the patriots and jailed; his wife soon died, and his property was confiscated. Upon release, William became president of the Board of Associated Loyalists in New York, where--neglected by the British and despised by the revolutionaries--he authorized one of the most notorious atrocities of the war, the hanging of Joshua Huddy. At war's end, Franklin fled into exile in England, hated by his countrymen, and disowned by the father he still venerated, and even loved.<br> Sweeping and authoritative, <em>William Franklin</em> captures some of the great issues and personalities of the Revolutionary era, and the bitterness of a family split between father and son, patriot and loyalist.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sheila L. Skemp</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Mississippi.<br>This book provides the first full-length biography of William Franklin (1730-1814), the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, who tried to reconcile conflicting interests in his political and personal life. It describes how Franklin, the last colonial governor of New Jersey, attempted to balance his allegiances to the Crown and the Colonies and was eventually arrested by the rebels as head of the Board of Associated Loyalists. He was exiled to England after the Revolutionary War. The book explains the disastrous effect of this political decision upon Franklin's relationships with his father and son, Temple, which deteriorated beyond repair after the war. This well-researched, sympathetic biography narrates the political changes and personal tragedies which resulted from the American Revolution.

Before studying art, he worked as a laboratory technician, and his continuing interest in science has had an enormous influence on his practice. In his early sculptural works, he often utilized everyday objects, assembling or stacking them to generate engaging new forms. In recent years, he has turned to an astonishing variety of more traditional materials, such as wood, bronze, glass, plaster, fiberglass, and plastics. As a self-proclaimed "absolute materialist," Cragg approaches these materials with a degree of scientific curiosity, responding to their various properties to produce his expressive sculptures.</p><p>This retrospective survey, made in consultation with the artist, focuses on Cragg's artistic output of the last ten years.

Much of this book is concerned with the valuation of derivatives. The aim is to present a unifying framework within all derivatives-not just options or futures-can be valued. </p>John Hull lectures at the Joseph L.

With a special focus on the relationship between shame and self-objectification, he proposes an innovative new theory that links shame to our sense of self from early development through maturity. In exploring this theme, Broucek--a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist--breaks new ground in understanding the development of the self, establishing a perspective on narcissism that differs markedly from traditional psychoanalytic concepts.<br>An illuminating overview of the modern literature precedes a provocative analysis of the role of shame in the formation of the self. Here, Broucek identifies the three major sources of shame: the infant's experiences of interpersonal inefficacy; self-objectification resulting in a kind of self-alienation or primary dissociation; and the experience of being unloved, rejected, or scapegoated by important others. In the course of development, these vectors cause the self's overinvestment in the idealized self-image and a devaluation of the actual self, an event explored in depth in the chapter on narcissism.<br>Broucek also addresses the role of shame in psychoanalysis and in society. The neglect of this emotion in psychoanalytic theory and technique, the author contends, results from a critical lack of understanding of shame and its effect--potentially adverse--on the practice of psychotherapy. Finally, Broucek's analysis of widespread shamelessness in modern times logically extends the ideas presented earlier.<br>Maintaining a critical balance in its coverage and interpretation, SHAME AND THE SELF marks a significant contribution to the understanding of the nature of shame and its role in our psychic life. As such, it is essential reading for all practicing psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health practitioners. <br></p><p>"Well written, informative, and easy [for me] to recommend to readers across the range of mental health professions....Broucek's proposals [are] logical and persuasive....His warnings to therapists command attention....[A] valuable addition[s] to the rapidly growing literature on shame...I highly recommend [this book]."--Joseph D. Lichtenberg in <i>The Psychoanalytic Quarterly</i><br><br>"Broucek's book is an imaginative and forthright discussion of an extremely powerful and painful phenomenon. As the author suggests, it may be this very intensity of feeling associated with shame that has paradoxically caused a lack of attention to the subject (until recently) in psychoanalytic literature. Broucek contends that psychoanalysts have ignored shame because of their own vulnerabilities to it--both personally and because shame is an almost inevitable component of the standard psychotherapeutic relationship...The necessary balance between shame and shamelessness that Broucek ultimately proposes provides an impressive conclusion to this important book."--Jon G.

Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school. At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing. An extremely productive novelist, Hardy published an important book every year or two. In 1896, disturbed by the public outcry over the unconventional subjects of his two greatest novels&#x2014;<b>Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Jude the Obscure</b>&#x2014;he announced that he was giving up fiction and afterward produced only poetry. In later years, he received many honors. He was buried in Poet&#x2019;s Corner, in Westminster Abbey. It was as a poet that he wished to be remembered, but today critics regard his novels as his most memorable contribution to English literature for their psychological insight, decisive delineation of character, and profound presentation of tragedy.</p><h2>The American Woman: Her Changing Social, Economic, And Political Roles, 1920-1970</h2><p>Examines the distribution of roles between the sexes over the past fifty years, paying particular attention to the economic role of women during periods of war and depression</p><p></p><h2>Rachel Ray (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Rachel Ray</em> offers a masterly and entertaining evocation of a small community living its life in mid-nineteenth-century England.

With clarity, verve, and the sure instincts of a good teacher, Madison Smartt Bell illuminates the process of narrative design. In essays and analyses of twelve stories by established writers and students, Bell emphasizes the primary importance of form as the backdrop against which all other elements of a story must work. Discussions of the unconscious mind and creativity reinforce other essentials of good writing. Madison Smartt</p><p>Rare it is to find an examination of the workings of the short story so diligent and loving as Madison Smartt Bell's in <i>Narrative Design</i>. According to Bell--a creative writing instructor and very fine fiction writer--"form or structure ... is of first <i>and</i> final importance to any work of fiction." Here, Bell scrutinizes the underlying architecture of 12 short stories--some by his students, others by the likes of Mary Gaitskill and William T. Vollmann. Bell is unstoppable, his discussion of the stories usually longer than the stories themselves. Every structural twist and turn is inspected, so that by tale's end we're reminded of those poor little frogs pinned for sixth-grade dissection, no bone left unturned. Bell's anatomy lessons are as eye opening as those of our youth (and a lot less gruesome), though I do recommend reading each story first in its entirety, only then backtracking for the bone by bone. <p> Were it not for Bell's insights regarding the fiction writer's juggling of craft and inspiration, a short-story writer might come away from this book completely paralyzed. Don't worry. Bell is well aware that the way in which a story comes into being is often as much of a mystery to the writer as to the reader. Though the stories included all demonstrate a strong structural logic, their writers, says Bell, "didn't plan it all. Probably could not have done so. At least not deliberately--not consciously." Instead, he writes, "Within the mind of every imaginative writer ... the faculty of conscious craftsmanship engages with the inexplicable choices and decisions of the unconscious mind. One of the writer's projects is always to try, somehow, to turn this engagement into less of a battle, more of a partnership." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Bell is the author of two short story collections and eight novels, including the National Book Award finalist All Souls Rising.</p><h2>Doorway to the World: The Mexico Years (The Memoirs of W.

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology Made Ridiculously Simple (Medmaster Series)</h2><p>Synoptic manual for medical students presenting the essentials of basic and clinical pharmacology.

In 1972 the United Nations meeting on National Parks and Protected Areas agreed to set up World Heritage Sites, now supervised by UNESCO, and at that meeting they voted Serengeti top of the list. What makes this site outstanding? What happens in Serengeti biologically? How did it become a protected area? What are the historical events that have shaped its present dynamics? What will happen to it in future? How has it become relevant to human society and conservation? These are the questions that Anthony Sinclair answers. <br><br>First arriving in Serengeti in 1961, he has worked as a scientist in this ecosystem since 1965, and continues to do so today. In the process he has documented not only the ecological events as the system has changed but also the political, economic, and social events that have driven these changes. Including personal accounts of the dramatic events brought about by the vicissitudes of political turmoil, he tells the story of Serengeti and its surrounding research. Providing the historical background - both the paleohistory going back 4 million years and the modern history of the region - he examines the future of conservation, considering the ominous threats facing the Serengeti today.</p><p><br>Professor Sinclair began his research in 1965 in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania on the population regulation of African buffalo. He subsequently studied the regulation of the wildebeest and other ungulate populations, looking at the effects of food supply and predation. He has examined the causes of migration and its consequences on ecosystem processes, and these have been compared to other systems in Sudan and Australia. He has documented multiple states in Serengeti savannah and grassland communities; expanding these interests to include bird, insect, and reptile faunas as part of the long-term dynamics of ecosystems. Until recently he was Director of the Centre for Biodiversity Research, University of British Columbia. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Society of Canada. He has published over 150 refereed scientific papers and seven books, the most recently with OUP.<br><br>"[Sinclair's] stories engage the reader as they range from successful but sometimes dangerous population count expeditions to outright research failures tied to lions, leopards, bandits, or whistling thorn acacia trees." --Biological Conservation<p><br>"[Sinclair's] stories engage the reader as they range from successful but sometimes dangerous population count expeditions to outright research failures tied to lions, leopards, bandits, or whistling thorn acacia trees." --<em>Biological Conservation</em></p><p></p><br></p><h2>Anthology of American Literature Volume II (Anthology of American Literature)</h2><p><p>This leading, two-volume anthology represents America's literary heritage from the colonial times of William Bradford and Anne Bradstreet to the contemporary era of Saul Bellow and Alice Walker.

His pioneering research on digestion, the brain, and behavior still provides important insights into the minds of animals--including humans--and is an inspiring example of imaginative experimental technique. Pavlov graduated from the theological seminary in his native Ryazan, Russia, in 1869 but almost immediately switched to medicine and enrolled at St. Petersburg University. He became interested in the physiology of circulation and digestion, which led him to the study of conditional and unconditional reflexes.

Yet it is clear from his autobiography and his letters that they had a significant impact on his art. Alongside his first oil painting, &#x201c;Bergriesen&#x201d; (&#x201c;Mountain Giants,&#x201d; 1895&#x2013;96), his alpine postcards of this period, in which the Swiss mountains appear as bizarre human physiognomies, also convey his fascination with the fantastical. His rejection of realism in favor of a grotesque, alternative world can be seen throughout his oeuvre, from its beginnings to the <i>Grotesken</i> (1905) and watercolors from 1918&#x2013;19, to the years under the Nazis when he was forbidden to practice his profession. This catalog, which includes works never before shown, is also the first to emphasize this fascinating side of the great painter and water-colorist.</p></p><p></p><h2>Mande Music: Traditional and Modern Music of the Maninka and Mandinka of Western Africa (Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology)</h2><p><p>With <i>Mande Music,</i> Eric Charry offers the most comprehensive source available on one of Africa's richest and most sophisticated music cultures.

In<i> Groundless Grounds</i>, Lee Braver argues that the views of both thinkers emerge from a fundamental attempt to create a philosophy that has dispensed with everything transcendent so that we may be satisfied with the human. Examining the central topics of their thought in detail, Braver finds that Wittgenstein and Heidegger construct a philosophy based on <i>original</i><i>finitude</i>&#x2015;finitude without the contrast of the infinite.</p><p>In Braver's elegant analysis, these two difficult bodies of work offer mutual illumination rather than compounded obscurity. Moreover, bringing the most influential thinkers in continental and analytic philosophy into dialogue with each other may enable broader conversations between these two divergent branches of philosophy.</p><p>Braver's meticulously researched and strongly argued account shows that both Wittgenstein and Heidegger strive to construct a new conception of reason, free of the illusions of the past and appropriate to the kind of beings that we are. Readers interested in either philosopher, or concerned more generally with the history of twentieth-century philosophy as well as questions of the nature of reason, will find <i>Groundless Grounds </i>of interest.</p></p><p>Lee Braver is Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Florida and the author of <i>Groundless Grounds: A Study of Wittgenstein and Heidegger </i>(MIT Press) and <i>A Thing of This World: A History of Continental Anti-Realism.</i><p>In this admirable book, Lee Braver sets out to bring out the parallels on various levels and on a wide range of subjects in the work of Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein, two elusive, and idiosyncratic thinkers. Thanks to his amazing grasp of what may well be the total works of Martin Heidegger and of Ludwig Wittgenstein, (as well as the views of a vast selection of relevant commentators) he is able to bring out deep parallels in the thought of these two thinkers. Indeed, Braver's unlikely project turns out to be a great success. Each of these difficult thinkers becomes more intelligible and convincing when read in the light of the other.</p>&#x2015;<b>Hubert L. Dreyfus</b>, Professor of Philosophy in the Graduate School, University of California, Berkeley<br><br><p>Continuing the project of his, <i>A Thing of this World</i>, Lee Braver once again shows how the traditions of analytic and continental philosophy overlap. <i>Groundless Ground</i>, however, demonstrates this philosophical intersection by investigating, in depth and in the clearest terms, the thought of Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Braver makes a strong argument not for moving beyond the analytic and continental traditions. Rather, Braver moves contemporary philosophy forward, beyond idealism and realism, by means of the thought of 'original finitude.'

Martin&#x2019;s formative years, however, have been largely overlooked. In this revelatory study of Martin&#x2019;s early artistic production, Christina Bryan Rosenberger demonstrates that the rapidly evolving creative processes and pictorial solutions Martin developed between 1940 and 1967 define all her subsequent art. Beginning with Martin&#x2019;s initiation into artistic language at the University of New Mexico and concluding with the reception of her grid paintings in New York in the early 1960s, Rosenberger offers vivid descriptions of the networks of art, artists, and information that moved between New Mexico and the creative centers of New York and California in the postwar period. She also documents Martin&#x2019;s exchanges with artists including Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe, Ad Reinhardt, and Mark Rothko, among others. Rosenberger uses original analysis of Martin&#x2019;s art, as well as a rich array of archival materials, to situate Martin&#x2019;s art within the context of a dynamic historical moment. With a lively, innovative approach informed by art history and conservation, this fluidly written book makes a substantial contribution to the history of postwar American art.</p><p>&#x201c;Christina Rosenberger deftly orients Agnes Martin&#x2019;s &#x2018;inspiration&#x2019; and facture toward an industrious past. Whilst dignifying Martin&#x2019;s desire to shield her audience from her more developmental and exploratory early career, Rosenberger maps a trajectory&#x2014;fueled by ambition, erudition, and talent&#x2014;toward the much-celebrated grid paintings of the 1960s. For the first time, Martin&#x2019;s surviving corpus of early work can be considered within the context of the various artistic communities she metabolized. Meticulous research and a genuine desire to &#x2018;see&#x2019; has become Rosenberger&#x2019;s hallmark.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rachel Barker, Modern and Contemporary Paintings Conservator, Tate<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Biographical readings of Agnes Martin&#x2019;s work abound, but scholarship that focuses instead on close art historical analysis of its form and facture has been lacking. <i>Drawing the Line </i>reorients the reader to her art, in particular the early work of 1940 to 1967. In this important new book, Christina Rosenberger argues that the creative solutions and artistic relationships Martin developed in this period shape all of her later work, including the nonobjective grid paintings for which she is most renowned.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michele Marincola, Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of Conservation, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As the art of Agnes Martin assumes ever-greater importance, Christina Rosenberger&#x2019;s <i>Drawing the Line </i>arrives to provide a vividly empathetic picture of the complete artist. With graceful style and acute analytical intelligence, she makes Martin&#x2019;s formative work crucial and compelling for any understanding of the artist.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas E.

Together the two works constitute the great innovation in philosophy for which Hutcheson is most well known.<br><br> The first half of the <i><b>Essay</b></i> presents a rich moral psychology built on a theory of the passions and an account of motivation, deepening and augmenting the doctrine of moral sense developed in the <b><i>Inquiry</i></b>. The second half of the work, the <b><i>Illustrations,</i></b> is a brilliant attack on rationalist moral theories and is the font of many of the arguments taken up by Hume and used to this day.<br><br> As editor Aaron Garrett notes, In the <b><i>Essay</i></b> Hutcheson provides his crucial argument against Hobbes and Mandeville, that not just egoistic self-preservation, but also benevolence, is an essential feature of human nature.&#x201d;<br><br> Professor Garrett has constructed a critical variorum edition of this great work. Because there are no manuscripts of the work, this could be done only by comparing all extant lifetime editions. Three such editions exist: those of 1728, 1730 (chiefly a reprint of the 1728 edition), and 1742. The Liberty Fund edition collates the first edition with Hutcheson&#x2019;s revision of 1742.<br><br> <b>Francis Hutcheson</b> was a crucial link between the continental European natural law tradition and the emerging Scottish Enlightenment. Hence, he is a pivotal figure in the Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics series. A contemporary of Lord Kames and George Turnbull, an acquaintance of David Hume, and the teacher of Adam Smith, Hutcheson was arguably the leading figure in making Scotland distinctive within the general European Enlightenment.<br><br> <b>Aaron Garrett</b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Boston University.<br><br> <b>Knud Haakonssen</b> is Professor of Intellectual History and Director of the Centre for Intellectual History at the University of Sussex, England.</p><p>F Hutcheson; Edited by A GarretFrancis Hutcheson's <i>Essay and Illustrations</i>, one of the finest examples of moral-theoretical argumentation in the literature of philosophy, has long been hard to find in any form and has never appeared, in its entirety, in a serious scholarly edition . . .The present volume therefore fills a genuine need, and on the whole it does so impressively.<br><br><b><i>Eighteenth-Century Scotland </i></b><br>Why read Hutcheson? Most students know of him vaguely, mainly as a precursor of Hume. "There is little or nothing in Hume's moral philosophy that cannot be traced to Hutcheson, but in Hume it is all more clear and pointed," wrote Arthur Prior in 1949 (<i>Logic and the Basis of Ethics</i>, 31). Many important strands of Hutcheson's thought do recur in Hume: his defence of the new theory of a moral sense and his rejection of rationalist theories of ethics, for instance, which, having quickly provoked objections from John Clarke, John Balguy and Gilbert Burnet, led to many of the revisions introduced in later editions of these two works. (The present text-critical editions make it possible for the first time to view these changes synoptically.) But Hutcheson's work explores other topics, many of them interesting in their own right, all of them of historical interest. <br><br>His central idea is that we have, in addition to the five external senses, also a sense of beauty and a moral sense. These senses were introduced in <b><i>Inquiry</i></b> (the two main parts of which, published in 1725, will be referred to as T1 and T2). Over time, the number of senses grew, among them, in Essay (also in two parts [1728]: T3 and T4), the public sense and the sense of honor. Experiences conveyed by these senses determine us, he argued, to judge things good or bad, and to decide for or against a course of action, without regard to self-interest: this anti-egoism mattered most to him. <br><br>Hutcheson explores other matters too, of course, in these important volumes. Morals without faith: He disputes the thesis that every action is a sin if it is undertaken without considering God. It would have the repugnant consequence that "the best of men are infinitely evil" (T4: 6.1, 187). The problem of evil: He also argues that contemplating the natural world will lead us to belief in a benevolent God. "How can anyone. . .even question a perfectly good Providence?" (T3: 6.3-4). Moral matters: the "conduct of the passions and affections" (roughly: the emotions and desires) covers a wide range, some of which, like his condemnation of the character traits Hume later described as the "monkish virtues," seems now mainly of historical interest. Others, for example those concerning honor killings and the sense of honor generally (T3: 5.8), have gained renewed relevance. Beauty: He insists, in Inquiry, on the beauty of the theorems and theories (T1: 3) offered by the deductive sciences (mathematics, physics), a kind of beauty neglected by all subsequent writers on aesthetics. (He also mentioned natural law theory like Pufendorf's, but omitted this in the fourth edition of T1.) Hutcheson also maintained that our delight at the works of nature is at least equal to, or else greater than, that inspired by works of art (T3: 6.2, 115). <br><br>Like other Liberty Fund publications, these volumes are elegantly designed, excellently produced, and moderately priced. To handle and read them is a pleasure. <br><br><b>Thomas Mautner<br>Australian National University<br><i>Ideas, Esthetics, and Inquiries in the Early Modern Era</i></b><br><b>Volume 11</b><br>English moral philosopher Hutcheson (1694-1746) noted criticism and commentary on his first publication, in 1725, when he wrote the double piece here, published in 1728. Garrett (philosophy, Boston U.) says his works were widely influential in England, continental Europe, America, and especially in Scotland after the last Jacobite rising in 1745. This edition is collated with Hutcheson's revision of 1742. <br><br><b><i>Reference &amp; Research Book News<br></i></b>February 2004</p><h2>Lament in the Night</h2><p><i>Lament in the Night</i> collects two remarkable novellas by the author Shosun Nagahara, translated from the Japanese for the first time. The title novella, originally published in 1925, follows itinerant day laborer Ishikawa Sazuko as he prowls the back alleys and bathhouses of Los Angeles, looking for a meal, a job or just someone to hold onto. The second novella follows a young mother working her way through bars and nightclubs after being abandoned by her gambling-addicted husband. Written in a deadpan tone that is both evocative and precise, this dazzling exercise in 1920s naturalist noir promises to become a classic of American literature. This first-ever English language publication of <i>Lament in the Night</i> opens up a whole realm of American literature that has been woefully underpublished and unexplored--namely, the literary heritage of non-English-speaking immigrants in America. Nagahara was influenced by many Western writers--especially Knut Hamsun, whose work he translated into Japanese--and his novels combine the gritty sensibility of Los Angeles noir with elements of Japanese traditional storytelling and epistolary techniques.</p><p></p><h2>Make Their Day!

There&#x2019;s a good chance that, in addition to your managerial duties, you are also an individual contributor. In terms of priorities, if you&#x2019;re like many managers, supervisors, and team leaders, recognition has come dead last. While this may be understandable, it is a big mistake.

They had the best intentions when they put &#x201c;recognize employees&#x201d; on to their to-do lists, and then, as the weeks progressed and pressing matters demanded their attention, they slowly moved recognition farther and farther down the list.

You need to think of recognition a little differently. Instead of adding recognition to your to-do list, make it the header. Find ways to make recognition part of every employee interaction. When you delegate, add a little praise of past accomplishments. When you receive project updates, thank employees for their promptness, thoroughness, or accuracy. When you hold a team meeting to talk about a new challenge, express confidence in the group&#x2019;s ability to meet that challenge.

There are hundreds of small things you can do to provide the recognition your employees crave without putting a greater strain on your time, things that positively affect the work environment because they provide the right kind of recognition. With the right recognition, you will find employees more willing to tackle problems on their own instead of bringing them to you to solve. With the right recognition, employees will show more concern about quality and reputation. With the right recognition, employees will be more willing to pitch in when things get difficult. Morale will go up. Absenteeism will go down. And your job will get easier.<br><br> 4<br> Recognition that works does this: it energizes and revitalizes the workplace. It creates a loyal, motivated, and productive workforce. And a loyal, motivated, and productive workforce makes your job as a manager easier.<br> Recognition That Works, Works!<br><br> Recognition that works, works&#x2014;even in the most challenging situations. Nothing demonstrates this quite as well as the story of Remedy Support Services that was featured in the first edition of this book.<br><br> In August 2001, Peregrine Systems purchased competitor Remedy Corporation. While managers at Remedy were hopeful that the purchase would help them expand their operations and increase market share, they still faced typical merger issues: concerns about possible layoffs, culture changes, product direction, and the priorities of the parent company&#x2014;challenges that many managers are very familiar with. During the next eight months, Peregrine Systems endured the same financial setbacks as most of the technology industry and suffered through the seemingly inevitable layoffs.<br><br> 5<br> This was only the beginning of the challenges that Remedy faced as part of Peregrine Systems. Peregrine announced it had misstated revenue during the past two years, and the CEO and CFO resigned.1 Remedy was restructured, and 5 percent of the workforce was laid off. Peregrine stock continued a steady decline; class action stockholder lawsuits accumulated; and by the time Remedy had been part of Peregrine Systems for ten months, Peregrine stock had been delisted from NASDAQ.2 Just over twelve months after it was acquired by Peregrine Systems, Remedy was sold to BMC Software.<br><br> Talk about a whirlwind of turmoil and change! Given the circumstances, it&#x2019;s easy to imagine employee morale would be at an all-time low. How could managers possibly keep employees productive under these conditions? Yet during the tumultuous tenmonth period from purchase to delisting, Remedy Support Service maintained employee morale and improved customer satisfaction ratings while continuing to grow its revenue stream!3<br><br> Mike Little, then VP of Worldwide Professional Services and Support, said the company survived and even thrived because the managerial staff set big goals, listened to employees, and showed their appreciation. As you will discover as you read this book, these three things are keys to offering meaningful and memorable recognition.<br> Visible Signs of Recognition<br> To bring employees through this crisis, Remedy Support Services used many forms of recognition. Pirate ships constructed by each of Remedy&#x2019;s support groups offered a reminder of a friendly competition to be the best support team. Some managers gave out stickers for perfect customer surveys, and employees displayed the stickers outside their cubicles. One employee was proud of a toy SUV his manager had presented him in recognition of his good work. Managers worked hard to find fun and creative ways to improve performance and show employees they were valued.<br><br> 6<br> Managers also held Employee Appreciation Days where they washed employees&#x2019; cars, prepared them food, played games, and dressed up in costumes. According to employees, Employee Appreciation Days isn&#x2019;t an event the organization simply puts on; it&#x2019;s something the managers do for them. When I met with employees, they were getting ready to celebrate Employee Appreciation Days. Because of budget cutbacks, little discretionary money was available. Many employees told me that instead of eliminating the celebration, managers chose to pay for it out of their own pockets. The gesture wasn&#x2019;t lost on the employees. It meant a lot to them.<br> Invisible Recognition<br> Many companies try friendly competitions, prizes, and events with little or no success. These things only worked for Remedy because managers offered another kind of recognition as well&#x2014;recognition that you might not even notice at first glance.<br><br> When I toured Remedy with Mike Little, he introduced me to many of the hundred-plus employees in support services. During those introductions, I discovered he knew everyone&#x2019;s name, how long each had been with the company, and where they had worked before. There was an easy camaraderie between Little and the unit&#x2019;s employees. It was apparent that one way he recognized employee value was by staying in touch with and caring about every individual.<br> Here is another example of this more subtle form of recognition. One of Remedy&#x2019;s tenets is &#x201c;Hire the best and then trust them.&#x201d; There is a lot of recognition in that statement if managers really believe it. Remedy managers proved they meant it when Peregrine Systems required a second round of layoffs. These managers refused to follow outlined procedures. During the first round, they had followed protocol: personnel followed laid-off employees to their desks, waited while they packed up their belongings, and then escorted them out of the building. Following this first round of layoffs, managers asked themselves, &#x201c;Where is the trust in doing it this way?&#x201d; They hated the message their actions sent.<br><br> 7<br> During the second round, they handled it differently. They allowed employees to spend as much time as they liked packing up their things and saying their good-byes. No one followed them around, and no one restricted their access. Some employees finished quickly, and others spent the entire day. Several thanked their managers for allowing them to leave in this manner. The way the managers handled the layoff was a small gesture, but it meant a lot to employees&#x2014;both those who stayed and those who left.<br><br> Managers at Remedy built recognition into every action and reaction. It was the header on their to-do list, and it made all the difference to employees. It is the reason why, in the face of unbelievable turmoil, Remedy Support Services consistently improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue. As you read the chapters that follow, you will learn why the people in your workplace consider the kinds of recognition that Remedy offered to be so important.<br> Proven Techniques<br> Throughout this book, you will learn about organizations that have demonstrated their ability to offer effective recognition. These organizations, as a whole, experience lower turnover and higher productivity and profitability than their industry averages. This point bears repeating: When employees give high ratings to the recognition they receive, their organizations typically have lower turnover and higher productivity and profitability than other organizations in the same industry! During economic downturns, these organizations lay off fewer employees; and, when they do have to reduce their workforce, employee morale is far more resilient.<br><br> 8<br> The firms that make Fortune magazine&#x2019;s annual list of the &#x201c;100 Best Companies to Work For&#x201d; provide great examples of organizations that offer many forms of effective recognition. According to Robert Levering, who along with Milton Moskowitz oversees Fortune&#x2019;s Best Companies project, &#x201c;No company can have a great place to work without having good ways to show appreciation to employees.&#x201d; Not only do the companies on the list do a good job of offering the kind of recognition employees value, but these companies also receive tremendous payback for their efforts. Levering and Moskowitz&#x2019;s research reveals the following:<br> Industry by industry, the companies on the list have 50 percent less turnover than their counterparts.<br> Publicly traded companies on the list average a 15 to 25 percent greater return for investors than the S&amp;P 500 over three-, five-, and ten-year periods.<br> The Make Their Day! philosophy is based on proven techniques. Each organization, department, manager, or supervisor highlighted in this book will help you understand what it takes to create meaningful recognition.<br><br> In the chapters that follow, you will learn how to create meaningful and memorable recognition that improves employee commitment to your organization. You will learn how to offer recognition that works and begin to look at recognition differently. You will train yourself to see what the recipient sees, looking past superficial symbols and focusing on what really matters. In the process, you will reduce your workload, improve productivity, and create a workplace where people love to work.</p><h2>Statistics for Social Understanding: With Stata and SPSS</h2><p>Statistics for Social Understanding: With Stata and SPSS introduces students to the way statistics is used in the social sciences--as a tool for advancing understanding of the social world.

Along the way, they double their weight by gorging on millions of tiny horseshoe crab eggs. Horseshoe crabs, ancient animals that come ashore but once a year, are vital to humans, too: their blue blood safeguards our health. Now, the rufa red knot, newly listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, will likely face extinction in the foreseeable future across its entire range, 40 states and 27 countries.

She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Vol. 3: 1400-1557 (Volume 3)</h2><p>This volume presents a collection of essays with an overview of the century-and-a-half between the death of Chaucer in 1400 and the incorporation of the Stationers&#39; Company in 1557. In this time of change the manuscript culture of Chaucer&#39;s day was replaced by an ambience in which printed books would become the norm. This volume traces the transition and discerns patterns of where, why and how books were written, printed, bound, acquired, read and passed from hand to hand with particular emphasis on imports and links with the Continent.</p><p>"The essays are truly ground-breaking.... All serious libraries will buy it; all students in the field will consult it regularly.

He has written a dozen non-fiction and fiction books, topping bestseller lists worldwide, and is published in some thirty languages. Two of his books are being made into feature films.Steve Grayling was crouched in a hidden position, the ink-black desert night deathly quiet all around him. Or at least it had been until the last few minutes of his sentry duty, which was scheduled to last from 0400 hours until first light. But then the first of the animals had appeared. <br> <br> In the open, empty quiet of the Iraqi desert his senses had been heightened, his hearing tuned in to the utter absence of life. The slightest noise would signify movement, which meant something living was out there, which in turn might signal danger. But the bone-dry rock and sand had offered little to remind him that he was still on earth and not on some barren, lifeless moonscape. <br> <br> That was how it had been for the first ninety minutes of his watch&nbsp;&#x2013; until, from out of nowhere, the herd of goats had appeared. The hollow tinkling of the animal&#x2019;s bell sounded alien and alarming as it beat out an eerie rhythm across the bare stillness. It seemed impossible that any four-legged creature could survive in a place so empty of water and vegetation&nbsp;&#x2013; yet here the goats were. And with the scraggly creatures had come the inevitable two-legged escort. <br> <br> Everything about the desert night was black. The moon was hanging low on the horizon, and above it the stars formed a skein of brightness that stretched across the heavens, but still the light intensity at ground level had to be no more than 10 millilux. Under such illumination the terrain all around him was so devoid of features as to form a flat, uniform void. <br> <br> It was only the goats that stood out, their erect forms casting long, leggy moon-shadows. The white splotches on their coats glowed silvery bright, like patches of polished chain mail set into a suit of dark armour. As for the goat-herder, he appeared giantlike, casting mighty distorted shadows as he walked, using a long stick to steer the herd to wherever it was he was heading. <br> <br>Steve Grayling hunched over the hulking great form of a .50-calibre heavy machine-gun, its barrel tracing the herd&#x2019;s every move. He&#x2019;d long lost the feeling in his hands. Come nightfall, the temperature plummeted in the desert, and he was stiff from the cold. Ice had seeped into his every joint and limb, yet still his frozen fingers gripped resolutely the twin handles of his weapon. He was minutely adjusting his aim, and poised to unleash a barrage of rounds onto the target&nbsp;&#x2013; that&#x2019;s if the goat-herder made the fatal mistake of stumbling onto their position. <br> <br>He hoped to hell that moment never came, for then he&#x2019;d have to decide whether or not to open fire. Steve faced a horrible dilemma; if he were to open fire it would be against all the rules of engagement and he might well face the full force of law for doing so&nbsp;&#x2013; for the goat-herder was no more than an adolescent kid. <br> <br>Killing kids: that wasn&#x2019;t what he had imagined doing when he&#x2019;d gone for selection into Special Forces. Back then he&#x2019;d fancied joining the elite, the few who dare, so he could take the fight to the bad guys, Britain&#x2019;s foremost terrorist enemies. Steve was one&nbsp;of the veterans of the Squadron, one of the &#x2018;old and the bold&#x2019;. Back when he&#x2019;d joined, Britain&#x2019;s chief enemy had been the IRA, and he&#x2019;d never for one moment imagined himself preparing to unleash a barrage of armour-piercing rounds against a kid. <br> <br>But if that goat-herder did blunder into their position and Steve didn&#x2019;t open fire, then he had few doubts about the consequences. They&#x2019;d have to consider their mission well and truly blown, and to expect the enemy to come after them relentlessly and in massive and deadly strength. After all, one of their units had already got shot up and hunted by Iraqi forces across miles of trackless desert&nbsp;&#x2013; prompting a series of battles from which its men had been very lucky to escape with their lives. <br> <br>The Squadron was a good 150 kilometres into Iraq by now. Although their route northwards lay through the empty wastes of the Ninawa Desert, due east lay the heavily populated area of Bayji, one of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s key strongholds. During the pre-mission briefings they&#x2019;d been warned that the population of Bayji&nbsp;&#x2013; both the military based there and the militias&nbsp;&#x2013; were fanatically loyal to the &#x2018;Great Leader&#x2019; Saddam. No doubt about it&nbsp;&#x2013; if Goat Boy saw them and raised the alarm, the Squadron was going to be in a whole world of trouble. <br> <br>The nearest animals had to be a good hundred yards away, but with every second they seemed to be drawing closer. With Grayling&#x2019;s open-topped vehicle shrouded in camouflage netting, and his face caked in several days&#x2019; worth of camouflage cream mixed with dried sweat and dirt, he figured the goat-herder would have to be right on top of their position before he noticed anything. He&#x2019;d likely have to peer long and hard into the bed of the wadi before the indistinct blobs might resolve themselves into the recognizable shapes of more than twenty four-wheel-drive vehicles&nbsp;and quad bikes. By that time Goat Boy would be just yards away from the gaping muzzle of Steve&#x2019;s weapon. He&#x2019;d be opening fire at point-blank range. <br> <br>A round unleashed from the .50-cal would leave the muzzle at a velocity of 2,910 feet per second. It would rip a cigar-sized hole where it hit, but exit leaving a gaping wound the size of a giant frying-pan. It was bad enough thinking of it doing that to a fully grown man, let alone to the body of an Iraqi kid, and Steve wanted nothing more than for those goats to piss right off out of there. <br> <br>Momentarily, he flicked his eyes away from the approaching threat, to do a visual check on their position. As the sentry for Six Troop of M Squadron, he had the northwestern segment of their position to keep watch over. His arc of responsibility ran from 12 o&#x2019;clock around to 4 o&#x2019;clock, 12 o&#x2019;clock being due north. <br> <br>To either side and humped along the jagged rim of the wadi he could just make out the silhouettes of two of the other sentries, the blokes from Four and Five Troop. Like him, they were hunched motionless over their vehicle-mounted weapons, the body of each of their wagons hidden in the cover of the dry riverbed. <br> <br>He had to assume the other sentries had heard, if not seen, the goats from where they were positioned. But it was towards his arc of fire that the foremost animals were heading, wandering across the flat desert and taking the occasional nibble at God only knew what. Over the three days that the Squadron had been pushing through the Iraqi wilderness, Steve had started to think that nothing could grow in this sun-blasted wasteland. <br> <br>Clearly, the goats knew otherwise. <br> <br>Steve shifted his gaze further east, towards the centre of the&nbsp;sheer-sided wadi. There sat the vehicles of their Headquarters Troop, the distinctive whippy antennae marking out the signals wagon. The HQ Troop was surrounded by the protective firepower of the sixty-odd men of the Squadron&nbsp;&#x2013; though all apart from the handful on sentry were sleeping the sleep of the dead right now. <br> <br>Steve had to assume that Reggie, their Squadron OC, was oblivious to the threat, but there was little point in alerting him to the goat-herder&#x2019;s presence, for the decision to pull the trigger would be Steve&#x2019;s and Steve&#x2019;s alone. If the herd kept its distance, the shepherd would live. If the animals came too close and the goat-herder got wise to M Squadron&#x2019;s presence, Steve would have to decide in that split second whether to open fire and kill him. <br> <br>There was no chance of trying to capture the little blighter. By the time Steve had made it out of the wagon&nbsp;&#x2013; fighting his way through the camo-netting as he went&nbsp;&#x2013; and clambered up the steep, rocky side of the wadi, the kid would be long gone. <br> <br>Regular soldiers in the British Army tended to be told when to eat, sleep or take a piss. Often, only the senior ranks carried a map, and the riflemen knew little about where they were going or what the bigger picture might be. Special Forces soldiering was a whole different ball game. Operators like Grayling were given the entire sketch of the mission, and they were sent out to find their own way and achieve the objective using their own drive and initiative. <br> <br>Decisions were based on intuition and past operational experience, and Steve had plenty of that to draw on. He&#x2019;d done several missions serving in joint SAS&#x2013;SBS units, and on many of those they&#x2019;d been outnumbered and outgunned. Those ops had given men like Grayling a baptism of fire at the hard and brutal end of soldiering. <br> <br>But the trouble was, Grayling had no experience to draw on whatsoever when it came to killing kids. <br> <br>He had no idea exactly how long he&#x2019;d spent on stag. He couldn&#x2019;t risk a glance at his watch. The slightest movement might draw the goat-herder&#x2019;s eye, plus the faintly luminous dial would shine out like a beacon in the dark. All he knew was that the horizon to the east was brightening slightly, which had to mean that first light&nbsp;&#x2013; 0600&nbsp;&#x2013; couldn&#x2019;t be that far away. <br> <br>Steve noticed a figure moving silently through the shadows of the dry riverbed. It was the Six Troop Sergeant Major. He paused to wake one of Steve&#x2019;s fellow Six Troop operatives. Dave Saddler was scheduled to take over from him on watch. He was lying comatose on the dirt next to one of the &#x2018;Pinkies&#x2019;, as they called their open-topped desert-adapted Land Rovers. <br> <br>You always woke the next guy a good fifteen minutes early, so he had time to get some food and liquid on board before taking over sentry. He could hardly set his watch to wake himself at the right time&nbsp;&#x2013; for even the faintest bleep-bleep-bleep or the brrrr of an alarm&#x2019;s vibrations could travel a great distance on the still desert air. So one bloke had to stay alert and organize the sentry rotation, waking the others at their allotted times. <br> <br>With Dave being wakened, Grayling figured it had to be around 0545, which meant that he had fifteen minutes in which to make the call. He didn&#x2019;t want to leave that decision to Dave, one of the youngest and least experienced operators in the Squadron. Steve had got him on his team in part so he could mentor him through the coming mission. <br> <br>Killing kids definitely wasn&#x2019;t the way to get him started. <br></p><h2>Neurobiological Foundations for EMDR Practice</h2><p><p>This volume introduces the most current research about the neural underpinnings of consciousness and EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) in regard to attachment, traumatic stress, and dissociation.

The centuries-old dominance of rationality, a mathematical mode of reasoning modeled on theory and universal certainties, has diminished the value of reasonableness, a system of humane judgments based on personal experience and practice. To this day, academic disciplines such as economics and professions such as law and medicine often value expert knowledge and abstract models above the testimony of diverse cultures and the practical experience of individuals. </p><p> Now, at the beginning of a new century, Toulmin sums up a lifetime of distinguished work and issues a powerful call to redress the balance between rationality and reasonableness. His vision does not reject the valuable fruits of science and technology, but requires awareness of the human consequences of our discoveries. Toulmin argues for the need to confront the challenge of an uncertain and unpredictable world, not with inflexible ideologies and abstract theories, but by returning to a more humane and compassionate form of reason, one that accepts the diversity and complexity that is human nature as an essential beginning for all intellectual inquiry. </p></p><p><b>Stephen Toulmin</b> is Henry R. Luce Professor at University of Southern California, and author of, among other books, <i>Cosmopolis</i> and <i>The Uses of Argument</i>.In elegant prose, Toulmin...contends that advocates of pure reason have forgotten "the complementary concept of reasonableness," a model of intellectual practice focused on values and experience rather than facts and theories. His rich conceptual history outlines the ways in which early modern science and philosophy separated reasonableness from rationality, and the resulting imbalance in all academic disciplines. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Toulmin shows in this readable and fascinating account, the practice of reason that produced modern science goes back to the 17th century, when traditional reasonableness was replaced by the model of geometry...Eventually--and this is perhaps one of Toulmin's most challenging insights--what came of this change is the system of disciplines that govern modern intellectual life...Throughout <i>Return to Reason</i>, Toulmin calmly addresses complex situations arising in modern disciplines. Indeed, the knack he shows for reasonableness illustrates his thesis. His book is both a diagnosis and, by example, a cure for what ails our scientific culture. (Thomas D'Evelyn <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> 2001-08-16)<br><br>There is now a 'loss of confidence'...in our traditional ideas about rationality, according to Toulmin. Especially among those in the humanities, he argues, the claims of rationality have been progressively challenged over the last 20 or 30 years, to the point of being sidelined. This is a common complaint and not exactly news, but Toulmin does not merely bemoan and rant, as many others have done. He offers a diagnosis and a solution. Rationality has come under threat, he believes, because of the undue influence of classical mechanics and abstract mathematical methods on our idea of what intelligent problem-solving should be. Deduction in the style of Euclid's geometry, mechanically predictable and rigorous law in the style of Galileo and Newton, indubitable certainty in the style of Descartes' 'I think, therefore I am' all exert a malign influence, insofar as they overshadow a looser, more pragmatic and less abstract concept of 'reasonableness.' What we need is more open-minded, informal reasonableness and less inappropriately mathematical rationality. Only then, Toulmin argues, can the idea of reason regain its rightful good name. (Anthony Gottlieb <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2001-08-19)<br><br>In this mature work, Toulmin...sums up a distinguished scholarly career spent tenaciously pursuing this and related questions. He adroitly integrates the arguments from his previous works...in a broad, humanistic vision of how to restore the balance of reason maintained in Greek antiquity...Toulmin employs a rich array of examples and accessible prose...Recommended. (T. B. Leiniger <i>Choice</i> 2002-04-01)<br><br>The argument in the book is wide-ranging and fluently expressed...Toulmin has taken on board arguments presented in debate by experienced practitioners, such as in the account of development economists and the water systems in Bali, his favorite vignette to illustrate the situatedness of economic relations. He ranges across the disciplines from astronomy to international relations, with a concern for professions, government policy making and the role of NGOs.

Theories and concepts concerning educational philosophy, methodology, curriculum, discipline, and assessment become more meaningful when explored in a case scenario in which the central characters confront situations that develop as a consequence of their or others' pedagogical choices. <br><br>The cases in this book also promote critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Each case is followed by questions that prompt readers to analyze the situation, formulate a plan of action to address the problem, and anticipate and evaluate the potential consequences of the plan's implementation. In small groups, individually, or as a whole class, readers can explore and debate their strategies for addressing the issues. Readers will learn there is no one right answer to situations that can occur in the education environment. They will develop their communication skills as they learn to articulate and defend a plan of action to address the situation, and they will also learn the importance of collaborating with colleagues as they listen to and learn from the ideas of others. <br><br>These cases were prepared by 36 experienced physical educators (from the elementary, secondary, and university levels)who collaborated in teams to create cases based on their collective, real-life experiences. As a result, the cases take place in a variety of contexts: in elementary, middle, and high schools; in urban, suburban, rural schools; and in wealthy and needy districts. They present a variety of issues encountered in schools today, including issues related to teaching methods, classroom management, multicultural education, classroom assessment, inclusion, relations with co-workers, marginalization of physical education, and gender equity. As in real life, each case raises a number of related issues that stimulate further discussion or provide opportunities for assignments. <br><br>This revised edition contains the same proven, effective case studies as in the first edition while incorporating minor updating throughout to reflect changes in technology and society since its original publication. </p></p><p>Contributors Pam Bechtel, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH Christine Bell, Riverside Elementary School, Dublin, OH John Blaine, Central Hills Elementary School, Powell, OH Luz Cruz, SUNY College at Brockport, Brockport, NY Nell Faucette, University of South Florida, St. Pete Beach, FL Roberta E.

Wuthrich, Springwood Elementary School, Havana, FL</p>If you have long looked for a way to bring the gymnasium into the classroom for critical issue discussions, this is a textbook for you. One of the difficult aspects of teacher training is trying to place students in a setting where relevant issues come alive and seem real. Case studies have been used in the past, but rarely have offered the requisite depth and feeling to make them realistic. Stroot and her collaborators have assembled a wide variety of case studies that are well written and carefully crafted. These studies focus carefully on problems that have long been "hotspots" in our profession. For example, topics such as role conflict, discipline, inclusion, teacher resisting change, and marginalization of physical education have long troubled many teachers regardless of their experience. Each of the 16 case studies has been written by a different set of authors who are able to successfully paint scenarios that come alive. <p>As I read these case studies, I was somewhat surprised at how easily I became immersed in them and even felt strong emotion because they seemed so authentic. The cases made me become part of the problem or issue. Soon I found myself thinking of ways to solve these problems. The studies increased my insight and awareness into some subtle and some not-so-subtle issues. </p><p>One of the strengths of this text is that each case study is followed by questions that encourage introspection and self-analysis. After reading a case study, students can take the time to think independently as they answer critical issue questions. Later, they can come together and share strategies, ideas, philosophies, and feelings. </p><p>If you want a text that will encourage your students to think and reflect, I recommend this one.

Spanning the rich history of Judaism from the Bible to today, David Biale shows how the secular tradition these visionaries created is a uniquely Jewish one, and how the emergence of Jewish secularism was not merely a response to modernity but arose from forces long at play within Judaism itself.</p><br><p> Biale explores how ancient Hebrew books like Job, Song of Songs, and Esther downplay or even exclude God altogether, and how Spinoza, inspired by medieval Jewish philosophy, recast the biblical God in the role of nature and stripped the Torah of its revelatory status to instead read scripture as a historical and cultural text. Biale examines the influential Jewish thinkers who followed in Spinoza's secularizing footsteps, such as Salomon Maimon, Heinrich Heine, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Einstein. He tells the stories of those who also took their cues from medieval Jewish mysticism in their revolts against tradition, including Hayim Nahman Bialik, Gershom Scholem, and Franz Kafka. And he looks at Zionists like David Ben-Gurion and other secular political thinkers who recast Israel and the Bible in modern terms of race, nationalism, and the state.</p><br><br><p> <i>Not in the Heavens</i> demonstrates how these many Jewish paths to secularism were dependent, in complex and paradoxical ways, on the very religious traditions they were rejecting, and examines the legacy and meaning of Jewish secularism today.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Not in the Heavens</i> offers a lucid and superbly informed overview of the major currents of secularization in modern Jewish thought. Its particular originality is in its persuasive demonstration of the roots of these trends in aspects of Jewish religious philosophy that go back to the medieval period and the Enlightenment."<b>--Robert Alter, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Although religious Jews have always anticipated spending 'next year in Jerusalem,' others have preferred to tarry, as it were, 'this year in Tel Aviv,' the symbolic capital of secular Jewry. This is their story, told by a master Jewish historian with erudition, sympathy, and full awareness of the ironies that tie both destinations--and the destinies of religious and secular Jews--inextricably together."<b>--Martin Jay, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"A rich and engaging work on the tradition of secular Jewish thought. Weaving together historical narrative and textual analysis, theology and philosophy, scripture and interpretation, and political theory and cultural criticism, Biale offers a provocative rethinking of Judaism's relation to the secular. <i>Not in the Heavens</i> is the most exhaustive and sustained discussion of Jewish secularism that I have read."<b>--Jerome E. Copulsky, Goucher College</b></p><p>"This is an excellent book. Biale provides an entirely new synthesis of a largely untouched subject.

There were thousands of deaths in the wake of that tragedy -- and thousands of heroes. Led by Police Commissioner Bernard B.

Cioffi shows writers how they can enliven argument--the organizing rubric of all persuasive writing--by drawing on emotion, soul, and creativity, the wellsprings of imagination. While Cioffi suggests that argument should become a natural habit of mind for writers, he goes still further, inspiring writers to adopt as their gold standard the <i>imaginative</i> argument: the surprising yet strikingly apt insight that organizes disparate noises into music, that makes out of chaos, chaos theory.</p><br><p> Rather than offering a model of writing based on established formulas or templates, Cioffi urges writers to envision argument as an active parsing of experience that imaginatively reinvents the world. Cioffi's manifesto asserts that successful argument also requires writers to explore their own deep-seated feelings, to exploit the fuzzy but often profoundly insightful logic of the imagination.</p><br><p> But expression is not all that matters: Cioffi's work anchors itself in the actual. Drawing on Louis Kahn's notion that a good architect never has all the answers to a building's problems before its physical construction, Cioffi maintains that in argument, too, answers must be forged along the way, as the writer inventively deals with emergent problems and unforeseen complexities. Indeed, discovery, imagination, and invention suffuse all stages of the process.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Imaginative Argument</i> offers all the intellectual kindling that writers need to ignite this creativity, from insights on developing ideas to avoiding bland assertions or logical leaps. It cites exemplary nonfiction prose stylists, including William James, Ruth Benedict, and Erving Goffman, as well as literary sources to demonstrate the dynamic of persuasive writing. Provocative and lively, it will prove not only essential reading but also inspiration for all those interested in arguing more imaginatively more successfully.</p><br><p>This edition features new chapters that cover the revision process in greater depth, as well as the particular challenges of researching and writing in the digital age, such as working with technology and avoiding plagiarism. The book also includes new sample essays, an appendix to help instructors use the book in the classroom, and much more.</p></p><p><p>"Would that I had read this book or taken Frank Cioffi's class fifty years ago. Better yet, I wish the contents of this book resided in the minds of all of us who produce soporific sentences in the name of 'technical' or 'professional' writing. If it did, we would all benefit. God knows I would read more technical papers. And kudos to the author for nicely making the point that creative writing is not solely the property of those who write fiction."<b>--James L. Adams, Stanford University, author of <i>Conceptual Blockbusting</i></b></p><p>"It's not enough to have an opinion or an idea. Writing well means making your reader follow, understand, agree or disagree, care. To do that you'll need the 'imaginative argument' Frank Cioffi explores here.

Not to worry, Barrows offers a primer on the trade of tricks, including blow-by-blow descriptions of sexual maneuvers supposedly exclusive to professionals. The sections dealing with why men stray, how they do it, how to catch them, and how to make them stop are often humorous but are told with a know-it-all condescension that grates. Barrows meanders among a wide array of options for rekindling a marriage that has lost its spark, even offering her favorite brand of lubricant.

Petty, MSc, MCSP, MMPA, MMACP, Principal Lecturer, School of Health Professions, University of Brighton, Eastborne, UK<p>The book has many strengths: it is written in an organised, logical user-friendly format with excellent accompanying graphics, giving detailed and precise descriptions in clear language. At the end of each chapter is an extensive reference list should the reader wish to explore particular topics in more detail. Written by a highly experienced manipulative therapist, this book would be a valuable guide to students and clinicians of various disciplines (including physiotherapists, manual therapists, chiropractors and osteopaths) involved in the management of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction. I cannot recommend this text highly enough: I personally found its earlier edition invaluable as a student during practical exams and clinical placements. For those seeking more extensive information on treatment options Petty's earlier text, Principles of Neuromusculoskeletal Treatment and Management- A guide for Therapists, serves as an excellent companion.</p> <p>Physical Therapy Reviews, December 2006</p></p><h2>Chardin</h2><p>Briefly traces the life of the eighteenth century French painter, looks at his major paintings, and discusses the unique qualities of his work</p><p>Pierre Rosenberg, the Chardin scholar and President-Director of the Mus�e du Louvre, had one overriding goal in mind when assembling the exhibition of which <i>Chardin</i> is the catalog: "to present the artist's finest paintings, the most perfect, the most harmonious, the paintings that leave nothing to be desired." The 99 paintings reproduced in this book are a testimony to the success of that endeavor. There are also six essays by Chardin experts and an extensively researched chronology.<p> Chardin's still lifes and genre scenes have been deeply appreciated for centuries for what Rosenberg calls "the grave, silent quality that encourages the onlooker to silent reverie." He is incapable of untruth: his subjects--jugs and bowls, glasses, cherries, housemaids, boys at play, dogs and cats--are painted without a touch of irony, embellishment, or drama. </p><p> It is painful to report that this volume is extremely disappointing visually, with plates that are either poorly reproduced or reproduced from poor transparencies and are slightly greenish or washed out. Except for details, which do show Chardin's close harmonies and painterly touch, the pictures look flat and dull. Art historians, of course, will see the paintings in the flesh and use this book as only an aide-memoire, but for ordinary, nonprofessional art lovers, the 20-year-old catalog of the great 1979 Chardin exhibition gives a far better sense of the quiet perfection of this subtle artist. Even a pocket book from Abrams' Discoveries series, <i>Chardin: An Intimate Art</i>, by Helene Prigent and Pierre Rosenberg, is far superior. Although its reproductions are minuscule by comparison, they are at least clear and clean, with colors that appear to be close to those of the original works. The little book may be only an hors d'oeuvre, but it has all the flavor that is missing in the full-course meal. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>The first fruits of Pierre Rosenberg&#39;s research were published in 1979 to great acclaim. This new work extends the boundaries of Chardin scholarship with new findings relating to the artist&#39;s life and the chronology of his oeuvre. Turning his back on the world of his contemporaries Fragonard and Boucher and evading easy but erroneous comparison with Flemish painters of interiors, Chardin gradually focused more and more on the spaces between objects rather than the objects themselves. As the details in his still life compositions shrink away, Chardin emerges as &#34;the painter of pure painting&#34; and the precursor of many artists a century or more later. Authoritative texts by Pierre Rosenberg and Renaud Temperini reveal Chardin&#39;s world, illuminated by his life, friends, and colleagues, and above all by the audience for whom he produced some of the most popular works of the eighteenth century.</p><h2>Earth and Life Through Time</h2><p>A revision of the best selling historical geology text, completely updated to provide a thorough but lucid introduction to the principles of historical geology.

The road and the cinema both flourished in the twentieth century, as technological advances brought motion pictures to a mass audience and the mass produced automobile opened up the road to the ordinary American. When Jean Baudrillard equated modern American culture with 'space, speed, cinema, technology' he could just as easily have added that the road movie is its supreme emblem.<br>The contributors explore how the road movie has confronted and represented issues of nationhood, sexuality, gender, class and race. They map the generic terrain of the road movie, trace its evolution on American television as well as on the big screen from the 1930s through the 1980s, and, finally, consider road movies that go off the road, departing from the US landscape or travelling on the margins of contemporary American culture.<br>Movies discussed include:<br>* Road classics such as <em>It Happened One Night</em>, <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby Road to films<br>* 1960's reworkings of the road movie in <em>Easy Rider</em> and <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em><br>* Russ Meyer's road movies: from <em>Motorpsycho!</em> to <em>Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!</em><br>* Contemporary hits such as <em>Paris Texas, Rain Man, Natural Born Killers</em> and <em>Thelma and Louise</em><br>* The road movie, Australian style, from <em>Mad Max</em> to the <em>Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.</em></p><p>Steve Cohan is Professor of English at Syracuse University.

Michael Paller looks at Tennessee Williams&#39;s plays from the 1940s through the 1960s against the backdrop of the playwright&#39;s life story, providing fresh details. Through this lens Paller examines the evolution of Mid-Twentieth-century America&#39;s acknowledgment and acceptance of homosexuality. From the early Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and one-act Auto-da-F� , through The Two-Character Play and Something Cloudy, Something Clear , Paller&#39;s book investigates how Williams&#39;s earliest critics marginalized or ignored his gay characters and why, beginning in the 1970s, many gay liberationists reviled them. Lively, blunt, and provocative, this book will appeal to anyone who loves Williams, Broadway, and the theater.</p><p>"Tennessee Williams was America's most original dramatic talent. He was also gay. The significance of this fact is explored by Michael Paller in a book full of striking insights into the man, the plays, and the theatre of which he was a part. What emerges from this study is a familiar figure seen in a new complexity. What also emerges is an America whose oppressive laws and casual cruelties toward those who shared his sexuality in part created the pressures which created the context, if not always the subject, of his art."--Christopher Bigsby, Professor of American Studies at the University of East Anglia and Director of the Arthur Miller Centre<br>MICHAEL PALLER teaches at Columbia University and the State University of New York at Purchase, and lives in New York City, USA.</p><h2>Riddles of the Sphinx and Other Mathematical Puzzle Tales (Anneli Lax New Mathematical Library, Series Number 32)</h2><p>Martin Gardner begins Riddles with questions about splitting up polygons into prescribed shapes and he ends this book with an offer of a prize of $100 for the first person to send him a 3 x# magic square consisting of consecutive primes.

This book examines the relationship between the reporter and his paper,...The pieces reprinted here frequently are interesting for their style and for what they tell us of the author&#39;s attitudes and experience. Also they are a record of events in San Francisco during the summer and early fall prior to President Lincoln&#39;s reelection. They made good reading then, and by and large they still do today. When a writer as creative as Clemens takes a city like San Francisco for his daily beat, is it surprising that the sparkle remains even a century (and nearly a half!) later?&#34; (From the Preface to this book.) Clemens of the Call contains nearly 200 pieces appropriately attributed to Twain. As a reporter of local items for the Call, Twain covers The Streets of San Francisco, San Francisco&#39;s Chinese, The Theatres, Etc., Crime and The Police Court, and serves as Critic and Political Reporter. Twain, as reporter, covers the most San Franciscan of all occurances--Earthquakes, and even the absence of earthquakes... &#34;The earthquakes are getting so irregular. When a community get used to a thing, they suffer when they have to go without it...we know of nothing that will answer as a substitute for one of those convulsions--to an unmarried man.&#34; In many of Twain&#39;s pieces we see Twain&#39;s satire and use of accepted stereotypes, &#34;employed at that time as much for comic purposes as for the expression of social criticism or of a sense of compassion for the wronged.&#34; (quote from the author&#39;s text) Twain&#39;s writing is never dull, and never without insight. This collection is rich!</p><p></p><h2>Henry F. du Pont and Winterthur: A Daughter`s Portrait</h2><p>World renowned for its vast woodland gardens, its 175-room house, and its unrivaled collection of American decorative arts, Winterthur in Delaware is today among the most beloved museums in the United States. In its earlier days Winterthur was the family home where Ruth du Pont Lord grew up and where her father, Henry F. du Pont (1880&#x2013;1969), envisioned and then brought to fruition his great museum of Americana.<br>In this memoir, Ruth Lord engagingly describes the development of Henry F. du Pont from a shy, lonely child, a seemingly hopeless student who had bad times at school, to a man who went on to achieve singular distinction in three disparate fields&#x2015;as art connoisseur, horticulturist, and eminent cattle breeder. Based on her personal experience, and on extraordinary family archives, the author provides a behind-the-scenes view of the legendary lifestyle of the du Pont family, brings to life other family members, including her brilliant mother and irrepressible aunt, Louise Crowninshield, and tells of her father&#x2019;s many additional activities, which culminated in his leadership role in Jacqueline Kennedy&#x2019;s White House restoration.</p><p>Henry F. du Pont, or Harry, as he was commonly known, was something of a pack rat. Luckily, he had exacting taste and meticulously documented his vast collection of antiques, furniture, and beautiful things. The son of the wealthy senator and Civil War hero Henry Algernon du Pont, Harry spent his early years floundering around in school, struggling both with academics and athletics, and found few, if any, pursuits at which he excelled. After graduating from Harvard with a less-than-stellar academic record, Harry moved back home to Delaware. There, for lack of anything better to do, he began to manage the family's vast estate, which included sprawling gardens and even bigger cattle farms.<p> Soon du Pont found his m�tier. He and his wife established four majestic homes--one each in Manhattan; Southampton; Boca Grande, Florida; and, most famously, Winterthur, Delaware--which they filled with their ever-expanding collection of antiques, art, carpets, and sundry knickknacks. Du Pont took immense pleasure in every detail of domestic life--carrying on a decades-long correspondence with a linens purveyor, for example, in which the two discussed every possible minutia of stitching and quilting, and carefully overseeing the choice of flowers, china, and even doilies for household luncheons.</p><p> In 1931, du Pont decided to share his passion with the public and dedicated his beloved Winterthur as a museum. After doubling its size to house all of its holdings, the museum opened in 1951. Du Pont did not stop there. He chaired the committee to save the Cooper Union Museum (now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design) and helped Jacqueline Kennedy redecorate the White House. This affectionate biography, written by the du Ponts' daughter, Ruth, offers an intimate view of one of the century's great cultural philanthropists. <i>--Anna Baldwin</i></p><b>Ruth Lord</b>, the younger daughter of Henry F. du Pont, spent much of her childhood at Winterthur.

To this conference were invited a number of mathematicians concerned with the mathematical theories of structural stability and catastrophe theory, and other mathematicians whose principal interest lay in applications to various sciences - physical, biological, medical and social. Rene Thorn and Christopher Zeeman figured in the list of distinguished participants. The conference aroused considerable interest, and many mathematicians who were not specialists in the fields covered by the conference expressed their desire to attend the conference sessions; in addition, scientists from the Battelle laboratories came to Seattle to learn of developments in these areas and to consider possible applications to their own work. In view of the attendance of these mathematicians and scientists, and in order to enable the expositions of the experts to be intelligible to this wider audience, I invited Professor Yung� Chen Lu, of Ohio State University, to come to Battelle Seattle in advance of the actual conference to deliver a series of informal lecture-seminars, explaining the background of the mathematical theory and indicating some of the actual and possible applications. In the event, Yung-Chen Lu delivered his lectures in the week preceding and the week following the actual conference, so that the first half of his course was preparatory and the second half explanatory and evaluative.

Today, while the U.S. enjoys tremendous military and economic power, citizens are increasingly insulated from everyday decision-making. This was not always the case. America, Aziz Rana argues, began as a settler society grounded in an ideal of freedom as the exercise of continuous self-rule&#x2015;one that joined direct political participation with economic independence. However, this vision of freedom was politically bound to the subordination of marginalized groups, especially slaves, Native Americans, and women. These practices of liberty and exclusion were not separate currents, but rather two sides of the same coin.</p><p>However, at crucial moments, social movements sought to imagine freedom without either subordination or empire. By the mid-twentieth century, these efforts failed, resulting in the rise of hierarchical state and corporate institutions. This new framework presented national and economic security as society&#x2019;s guiding commitments and nurtured a continual extension of America&#x2019;s global reach. Rana envisions a democratic society that revives settler ideals, but combines them with meaningful inclusion for those currently at the margins of American life.</p></p><p>Aziz Rana is Professor of Law at Cornell Law School.&#x201c;This provocative book will interest all American historians... A brief review cannot do justice to the intricacy and subtlety of Rana&#x2019;s argument. He deploys evidence from a dazzling range of sources, particularly but not exclusively from imaginative readings of pivotal court cases... <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i>...establishes Rana as a serious student of American democracy, and all readers of the <i>Journal of American History</i> should wrestle with his brilliant and passionate critique of &#x2018;settler empire.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James T. Kloppenberg</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of American History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i>, Rana effectively weaves together historical analysis, constitutional interpretation, and theoretical reflections, showing that empire is more deeply intertwined with American political institutions and their development than many observers realize... Both its compelling historical interpretation and its innovative examination of normative criticisms through the discussion of contemporary social critics make this an important book that neither students of American political and constitutional development nor those interested in political theory and thought can afford to ignore.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stefan Heumann</b><b>, </b><b><i>Political Science Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is interpretive history, and, as the title indicates, it is interpretive history with bite... <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i> is a marvelous tract for our times... The best thing about this book is that Rana has compiled a wonderful pantheon of also-rans in American history who either offered alternatives to &#x2018;settler society,&#x2019; or actually tried to fulfill its promise of freedom and equality... The book also includes novel and penetrating analysis of the work and thought of better-known figures in American history... [A] tour-de-force.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen B. Presser</b><b>, </b><b><i>Reviews in American History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This] is a significant contribution to constitutional scholarship. One of the virtues of <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i> is Rana&#x2019;s willingness to take intellectual risks... While Rana is not the first legal scholar to examine the link between republican freedom and imperial expansion in American constitutional history, he is the first to do so through the lens of settler colonial theory... By applying this theoretical framework, Rana offers a provocative and original narrative of how early American ideas of freedom and imperialism were interdependent, and together animated what was once a formative ideology underpinning American constitutional governance... <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i> is a significant theoretical accomplishment. It successfully taps the insights of a discipline unfamiliar to many legal scholars, and by doing so offers a novel interpretation of America&#x2019;s constitutional past. This interpretation suggests new and challenging ways of thinking about the relationship between national power and domestic freedom.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony O&#x2019;Rourke</b><b>, </b><b><i>Michigan Law Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Overall, this book is masterfully crafted. To say that ideas matter is easy. To demonstrate how ideas inform and are informed by our understandings, practices, and institutions in a dynamic manner across a wide ideological and historical spectrum is quite another... The challenge Rana sets forth&#x2015;politically, conceptually and methodologically&#x2015;is daunting in that it captures the kind of urgency, creativity and diligence that every intellectual should aspire for.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Kato</b><b>, </b><b><i>Constellations</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rana&#x2019;s interpretation of the American past helps make sense of the Revolution&#x2019;s democratic potential, and also the problems facing American democracy today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Johann Neem</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] provocative, revisionist tale that finds the key to apparently contradictory strains in American political culture, political thought, and notions of citizenship in our own dual past as settler and colonizer... [It] seems clear that Rana&#x2019;s re-telling of the American story is one that will be debated and should be reckoned with, both for its bold sidelong glance at familiar history&#x2015;especially the manner in which it outlines the case for how and why we moved almost immediately from colony to colonizer&#x2015;and for its potential implications for the present political moment. Scholars of immigration history and policy, American foreign policy, and American political thought will all find arguments worthy of consideration and deserving of their attention, along with fresh perspectives on what might ordinarily be stale terrain.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Pimpare</b><b>, </b><b><i>Law &amp; Politics Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] ambitious and thoughtful book... <i>The Two Faces of American Freedom</i> [is] a challenging and often compelling book. It is well written, full of fresh interpretations of familiar debates, and unafraid to pose big questions and draw striking conclusions where others often fear to tread.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Duncan Ivison</b><b>, </b><b><i>Perspectives on Politics</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Two Faces of American Freedom</i> is an impressive piece of historical scholarship... [Rana] provides insightful new interpretations of several critical points in the United States&#x2019; political development... It would be difficult to overstate the originality and importance of Rana&#x2019;s portrayal of the American Revolution as &#x2018;settler revolt.&#x2019;... By making imperialism and settlerism central concepts in his approach to the American Revolution, Rana deals a devastating blow to scholarship committed to American exceptionalism, which has sequestered the study of American history and politics for too long. If this were <i>Two Faces</i>&#x2019; only contribution, it would be quite a worthy book, but in subsequent chapters, Rana extends his analysis through history, tracing the evolution of settlerism in the years between the ratification of the Constitution and the Civil War, and between Reconstruction and the turn of the twentieth century... In <i>Two Faces</i>, Rana uses the concept of settler colonialism to illuminate the American experience in an unassailably effective and innovative manner... <i>Two Faces</i> is a compelling work because it expands the compass of inquiry, opening the way to comparative approaches that were previously closed off by scholarly commitments to American exceptionalism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joshua Simon</b><b>, </b><b><i>Settler Colonial Studies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rana makes a compelling case for a populist account of self-rule at the heart of the U.S. political tradition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>M.

The book focuses on a diverse set of images that include a depiction of former slaves whipping their erstwhile overseer distributed by an African American publisher, a census graph published in the <i>New York Times</i>, and a cutout of a child&#x2019;s hand sent by a southern mother to her husband at the front.

A number of essays focus in particular on African American engagements with visual culture. The collection also emphasizes the role that women played in making, disseminating, or interpreting wartime images.

Lane uncovers a "green theology" that celebrates a community of jubilant creatures of all languages and species. Lane reveals an ecologically sensitive Calvin who spoke of himself as ''ravished'' by the earth's beauty. He speaks of Puritans who fostered a ''lusty'' spirituality in which Christ figured as a lover who encouraged meditation on the wonders of creation. He presents a Jonathan Edwards who urged a sensuous ''enjoyment'' of God's beauty as the only real way of knowing God.<br><br>Lane argues for the ''double irony'' of Reformed spirituality, showing that Calvinists who often seem prudish and proper are in fact a people of passionate desire. Similarly, Reformed Christians who appear totally focused on divine transcendence turn out at times to be closet nature mystics, exulting in God's glory everywhere. Lane also demonstrates, however, that a spirituality of desire can be derailed, ending in sexual excess and pantheism. Ecologically, holy longing can be redirected from a contemplation of God's splendor in the earth's beauty to a craving for land itself, resulting in disastrous misuse of its resources.<br> Between the major chapters of the book are engaging personal essays drawn from the author's own love of nature as a Reformed Christian, and providing a thoughtful discussion of contemporary issues of species diversity and the honoring of an earth community.<br></p><p><br><strong>Belden C.

Formal mathematics prerequisites are minimal; calculus is not required. There are no computer science prerequisites. The book includes examples, exercises, figures, tables, sections on problem-solving, section reviews, notes, chapter reviews, self-tests, and computer exercises to help the reader master introductory discrete mathematics. In addition, an Instructor's Guide and World Wide Web site are available. </p><p> The main changes in this edition (discussed in more detail later) are an expanded discussion of logic and proofs, the addition of two sections on discrete probability, a new appendix that reviews basic algebra, many new examples and exercises, section reviews, and computer exercises. OVERVIEW </p><p> In the early 1980s there were almost no books appropriate for an introductory course in discrete mathematics. At the same time, there was a need for a course that extended students' mathematical maturity and ability to deal with abstraction and also included useful topics such as combinatorics, algorithms, and graphs. The original edition of this book (1984) addressed this need. Subsequently, discrete mathematics courses were endorsed by many groups for several different audiences, including mathematics and computer science majors. A panel of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) endorsed a year-long course in discrete mathematics. The Educational Activities Board of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) recommended a freshman discrete mathematics course. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE accreditation guidelines mandated a discrete mathematics course. This edition, like its predecessors, includes topics such as algorithms, combinatorics, sets, functions, and mathematical induction endorsed by these groups. It also addresses understanding and doing proofs and, generally, expanding mathematical maturity. ABOUT THIS BOOK </p><p> This book includes</p><p>Logic (including quantifiers), proofs, proofs by resolution, and mathematical induction (Chapter 1). Sets, sequences, strings, sum and product notations, number systems, relations, and functions, including motivating examples such as an application of partial orders to task scheduling (Section 2.4), relational databases (Section 2.7), and an introduction to hash functions and pseudorandom number generators (Section 2.8). A thorough discussion of algorithms, recursive algorithms, and the analysis of algorithms (Chapter 3). In addition, an algorithmic approach is taken throughout this book. The algorithms are written in a flexible form of pseudocode. (The book does not assume any computer science prerequisites; the description of the pseudocode used is self-contained.) Among the algorithms presented are the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (Section 3.3), tiling (Section 3.4), the RSA public-key encryption algorithm (Section 3.7), generating combinations and permutations (Section 4.3), merge sort (Section 5.3), Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm (Section 6.4), backtracking algorithms (Section 7.3), breadth-first and depth-first search (Section 7.3), tree traversals (Section 7.6), evaluating a game tree (Section 7.9), finding a maximal flow in a network (Section 8.2), finding a closest pair of points (Section 11.1), and computing the convex hull (Section 11.3). A full discussion of the "big oh," omega, and theta notations for the growth of functions (Section 3.5)., Having all of these notations available makes it possible to make precise statements about the growth of functions and the complexity of algorithms. Combinations, permutations, discrete probability, and the Pigeonhole Principle (Chapter 4). Recurrence relations and their use in the analysis of algorithms (Chapter 5). Graphs, including coverage of graph models of parallel computers, the knight's tour, Hamiltonian cycles, graph isomorphisms, and planar graphs (Chapter 6). Theorem 6.4.3 gives a simple, short, elegant goof of the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm. Trees, including binary trees, tree traversals, minimal spanning trees, decision trees, the minimum time for sorting, and tree isomorphisms (Chapter 7). Networks, the maximal flow algorithm, and matching (Chapter 8). A treatment of Boolean algebras that emphasizes the relation of Boolean algebras to combinatorial circuits (Chapter 9). An approach to automata emphasizing modeling and applications (Chapter 10). The SR flip-flop circuit is discussed in Example 10.1.11. Fractals, including the von Koch snowflake, are described by special kinds of grammars (Example 10.3.19). An introduction to computational geometry (Chapter 11). An appendix on matrices, and another that reviews basic algebra. A strong emphasis on the interplay among the various topics. As examples, mathematical induction is closely tied to recursive algorithms (Section 3.4); the Fibonacci sequence is used in the analysis of the Euclidean algorithm (Section 3.6); many exercises throughout the book require mathematical induction; we show how to characterize the components of a graph by defining an equivalence relation on the set of vertices (see the discussion following Example 6.2.13); and we count the number of n-vertex binary trees (Theorem 7.8.12). A strong emphasis on reading and doing proofs. Most proofs of theorems are illustrated with annotated figures. Ends of proofs are marked with a square symbol. Separate sections (Problem-Solving Corners) show students how to attack and solve problems and how to do proofs. Numerous worked examples throughout the book. (There are over 500 worked examples.) A large number of applications, especially applications to computer science. Over 3500 exercises, with answers to about one-third of them in the back of the book. (Exercises with numbers in color have an answer in the back of the book.) Figures and tables to illustrate concepts, to show how algorithms work, to elucidate proofs, and to motivate the material. Several figures illustrate proofs of theorems. The captions of these figures provide additional explanation and insight into the proofs. Section reviews. Notes sections with suggestions for further reading. Chapter reviews. Chapter self-tests. Computer exercises. A reference section containing 150 references. Front and back endpapers that summarize the mathematical and algorithm notation used in the book. CHANGES FROM THE FOURTH EDITION The first chapter on logic and proofs is considerably enhanced. Several new motivating examples have been added. A logic game, which offers an alternative way to determine whether a quantified propositional function is true or false, is discussed in Example 1.3.17. Section 1.4 now includes rules of inference for both propositions and quantified statements. The number of exercises in this chapter has been increased from 232 to 391. Arrow diagrams have been added to give a pictorial view of the definition of a function, one-to-one functions, onto functions, inverse functions, and the composition of functions (see Section 2.8). Graphs of functions have been added to give yet another view of functions (see Section 2.8). Two optional sections (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) have been added on discrete probability. We discuss the fundamental terminology (e.g., experiment, event), the use of counting techniques to compute probabilities, basic formulas, mutually exclusive events, conditional probability, independent events, and Bayes' Theorem and its use in pattern recognition. The setting for the Problem-Solving Corner in Chapter 5 has been changed to a more inviting and contemporary setting: sorting in a spreadsheet. The fourth edition's Section 8.5 on Petri nets has been moved to the Web site that accompanies this book. Appendix B, which reviews basic algebra, has been added.

That's precisely why Gerald J. Davis has put countless hours of work into researching and translating the tales from Middle English into a more contemporary, accessible dialect.

The vignettes that Chaucer has painted of the various facets of English society remain as sharp as ever, and Davis has made perfectly sure that none of those biting observations ever gets lost in translation. No summary of the tales would do their portraiture justice, but suffice it to say that there are dozens of short stories that comprise the work, and each is more delightful than the last.

The personality of the young monarch was undoubtedly a factor in this transition, yet there has been&nbsp;much controversy over the King's character. Was Edward a vain and self-indulgent playboy, more interested in his own pleasures than the well-being of his kingdom, or was his life cut tragically short, thus preventing him from fully establishing the 'new monarchy' now more commonly associated with his son-in-law, Henry VII?</p> <p>A&nbsp;central personality&nbsp;in both&nbsp;historical study and literary fame,&nbsp;Edward IV is as&nbsp;fascinating a character&nbsp;now as he was for William Shakespeare over four centuries ago.

It is a property of widespread scientific importance and is at the centre of much of the recent work in chaos, fractals, and other areas of current research and popular interest. Self-similarity is related to svmmetry and is an attribute of many physical laws: particle physics and those governing Newton&#39;s laws 0 , gravitation. Symmetry, found throughout the biological universe, is also a basic property of the mathematical universe. In this book the author explores the ideas of scaling, self-similarity, chaos and fractals as they appear throughout the universe of pure and applied mathematics. Because of his formidable research experience, stretching from the acoustical modelling of concert halls to pure number theory, Schroeder is able to take the reader on an intellectual excursion through this vast forest of topics.</p><p>Manfred Schroeder is a pioneer in the artistic potential of computer graphics, a world-renowned expert in concert hall acoustics, and holder of over 45 patents.

Self-similarity in computer graphics yields the awesome fractal mountain patterns that have made chaos a visible theory for many nonmathematicians. Readers with good command of calculus and some physics will appreciate how far chaos theory has penetrated theoretical physics, biology and the practice of research as described in puns, illustrations and puzzles by this 20th-century Lewis Carroll. Without those skills, however, readers may stand like Alice before a small door that opens on strange new wonders of the physical world, the extended horizons of number theory and advanced math recreation.

Covering almost 1,800 years, <strong><em>The History of England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688</em></strong> was the work that established Hume&#x2019;s reputation in his own time.</p> <p>Hume saw English history as a process of the evolution from a government of will to a government of law. He believed that political, social, and economic liberty was neither inevitable nor necessary, but contingent and dependent for its preservation on an understanding of the conditions that gave rise to it and the institutional arrangements that sustain it. This argument, which runs through all six volumes, expressed in Hume&#x2019;s masterful prose, continues to make the <em>History</em> a valuable study for the modern reader.</p> <p>This Liberty Fund edition is based on the edition of 1778, the last to contain corrections by Hume. The typography has been modernized for ease of reading. Hume&#x2019;s own index to the entire work may be found at the conclusion of <em>Volume VI</em>.</p></p><p>David Hume was an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist, and the author of A Treatise of Human Nature, considered by many to be one of the most important philosophical works ever published.<p>Hume attended the University of Edinburgh at an early age and considered a career in law before deciding that the pursuit of knowledge was his true calling. Hume s writings on rationalism and empiricism, free will, determinism, and the existence of God would be enormously influential on contemporaries such as Adam Smith, as well as the philosophers like Schopenhauer, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Popper, who succeeded him. Hume died in 1776.</p><i>Hume's <b>History</b> deserves to be ranked with such works as Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War and Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. . . . The theme of liberty, above all others, gives continuity to Hume's detailed examination of English constitutional development from the Anglo-Saxon period to the Revolution of 1688.</i><p><b>-- Eugene F.

Provides a fascinating theoretical introduction to the phenomena, detailed case study experiences, and a final training guide for practitioners...a landmark work.<br> --Kevin Clements, director, Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University<br> <br> Presenting a brilliant new approach to conflict resolution that will intrigue and inform practitioners and scholars alike. Writing from his remarkable range of academic and real-world experiences--including his historic work in bringing Israel and the PLO to the negotiation table--Rothman shows how identity-based conflict can be managed so that both parties reach a higher ground than either could have found on its own. His vehicle is his ARIA model, and here he traces the ARIA process through Antagonism, Resonance, Invention, and Action, demonstrating step-by-step how it can be applied in a variety of environments. Complete with field-tested assessment instruments and action plans, Resolving Identity-Based Conflict is a seamless union of theory and practice anyone seeking to turn the passion of conflict into the fuel of creativity can use.</p><p>Conflict can either destroy or create--depAnding on whether and how it is guided. This is the simple yet profound insight that underlies Jay Rothman's innovative new framework for understanding and transforming identity-based conflict in nations, organizations, and communities. Reading a newspaper, working in an organization, or sitting in on a town meeting can provide vivid examples of identity conflicts in action. Based in the national, organizational, and community groups that provide individuals with meaning, safety, and dignity, identity conflicts are passionate and volatile because they strike at our core: who we really are and what we care about most deeply. Though often impervious to traditional methods of conflict management, identity-based conflict also provides adversaries with dynamic opportunities for finding not only common ground, but higher ground than separate parties could have found on their own. Grounded in his grassroots conflict resolution work in the Middle East -- work that earned him the honor of witnessing the historic White House handshake between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO President Yasser Arafat -- and brilliantly refined to address a wide range of organizational and community conflicts, Rothman's ARIA model is a versatile and innovative synthesis of the best contemporary ideas in conflict management, resolution, and transformation. Step by step, Resolving Identity-Based Conflict traces the ARIA journey through Antagonism, Resonance, Invention, and Action in a variety of environments. In straightforward, jargon-free language, Rothman conveys solid theoretical insights and practical how-to's that allow researchers and practitioners to: <ul> <li>Recognize the crucial differences between identity- and resource-based conflicts</li> <li>Zero in on the needs and motivations shared by even the bitterest of adversaries</li> <li>Create joint agendas for groups in conflict</li> <li>Transform intragroup and intergroup conflicts in organizations of every k</li> </ul>Can deep-seated indentity-based conflicts between passionately adversarial groups bring out the best as well as the worst in people? Drawing on his remarkable range of academic and conflict resolution experiences around the world, Jay Rothman shows how to harness the creative and tranformational power of conflict in our organizations, neighborhoods, and nations.</p><h2>Torture and Dignity: An Essay on Moral Injury</h2><p>In this unflinching look at the experience of suffering and one of its greatest manifestations&#x2014;torture&#x2014;J. M. Bernstein critiques the repressions of traditional moral theory, showing that our morals are not immutable ideals but fragile constructions that depend on our experience of suffering itself. Morals, Bernstein argues, not only guide our conduct but also express the depth of mutual dependence that we share as vulnerable and injurable individuals. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Beginning with the attempts to abolish torture in the eighteenth century, and then sensitively examining what is suffered in torture and related transgressions, such as rape, Bernstein elaborates a powerful new conception of moral injury. Crucially, he shows, moral injury always involves an injury to the status of an individual as a person&#x2014;it is a violent assault against his or her dignity. Elaborating on this critical element of moral injury, he demonstrates that the mutual recognitions of trust form the invisible substance of our moral lives, that dignity is a fragile social possession, and that the perspective of ourselves as potential victims is an ineliminable feature of everyday moral experience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>J. M. Bernstein </b>is distinguished professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research. He is the author of many books, including <i>Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics</i>; <i>Against Voluptuous Bodies: Adorno&#x2019;s Late Modernism and the Meaning of Painting</i>; and <i>Recovering Ethical Life: J�rgen Habermas and the Future of Critical Theory</i>.&#x201c;For many years now Bernstein has been a leading voice in the evolving critical theory tradition, turning out impressive and influential work on Luk�cs, Adorno, the relation between art and philosophy, and social critique. <i>Torture and Dignity</i> is his most ambitious and systematic book. Taking his bearings from what are the clearest, most unambiguous cases of moral injury&#x2014;torture and rape&#x2014;he aims to develop a general account of the nature of moral wrong, and he does so without engaging the conventional (and, he argues, thoroughly misleading and distorting) problem of convincing the moral skeptic to refrain from such harm. What results is a book that is lucidly written, original, passionate, and compelling, with many moments of real brilliance. His ability to develop out of such a &#x2018;negative ethics&#x2019; a positive account of our dependence on each other is no less valuable and challenging. The book is a major achievement.&#x201d; (Robert B. Pippin, author of Interanimations: Receiving Modern German Philosophy)<br><br>&#x201c;There is a lot we can learn from topics most of us would rather avoid thinking about. Here, Bernstein does much of the difficult work for us, bringing rape and torture into the general discussions of human dignity, moral injury, and the nature of persons. A much-needed book, and brilliantly argued.&#x201d;&#x2014; (Linda Mart�n Alcoff, author of The Future of Whiteness)<br><br>&#x201c;This book has two topics, dignity and torture&#x2014;each of which has assumed great importance in the last twenty years.&nbsp;Bernstein contrasts torture with the rule of law and human dignity with violation and degradation. I cannot imagine a better account of the affront to dignity posed by the terrible practice of torture.&#x201d; (Jeremy Waldron, author of Torture, Terror, and Trade-Offs: Philosophy for the White House)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Torture and Dignity </i>raises a number of important issues in moral philosophy and moral practice in a way that is original and highly engaging. Bernstein is a brilliant writer whose passion and conviction come across vividly and persuasively in a breadth of styles and approaches, which is so unusual in contemporary ethics. In this work we see a philosopher engaged in analysis and argument, but also with literature, phenomenology, memoir, law, the history of ideas, and public policy.&#x201d; (Robert Stern, author of Understanding Moral Obligation: Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard)</p><h2>The Dead Wife</h2><p><p><strong>The <em>USA Today</em> and #1 eBook bestseller of <em>The Girl Who Lied</em> and <em>Sister Sister</em></strong></p><p><strong>SINCLAIR WIFE DEAD!&nbsp; HUSBAND CLEARED!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Police have ruled out suspicious circumstances in the investigation into the death of Elizabeth Sinclair, wife of charismatic entrepreneur Harry Sinclair, found drowned in the lake of the family&#x2019;s holiday park. </strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s been two years since the Sinclair case closed but when reporter Steph Durham receives a tipoff that could give her the scoop of the year, she&#x2019;s drawn deeper and deeper into the secretive Sinclair family.</p><p>Elizabeth&#x2019;s death wasn&#x2019;t a tragic accident.

Each play is presented with Shakespeare's original lines on each left-hand page, and a modern, easy-to-understand "translation" on the facing right-hand page. All dramas are complete, with every original Shakespearian line, and a full-length modern rendition of the text. These invaluable teaching-study guides also include:<br>1. Helpful background information that puts each play in its historical perspective.<br>2. Discussion questions that teachers can use to spark student class participation, and which students can use as springboards for their own themes and term papers.<br>3. Fact quizzes, sample examinations, and other features that improve student comprehension of what each play is about.<br></p><p>William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, on England&#x2019;s Avon River. When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.</p><h2>Social Theory &amp; Social Change</h2><p>Understanding and explaining the causes and consequences of social change has been an important concern of social theorists throughout the history of sociology. This wide-ranging text focuses on a rich and diverse body of theoretical work, from Adam Smith and Comte to Lyotard and Baudrillard, in order to demonstrate the relevance of both classical and contemporary social theory to the wider social world and to show that, while social theory may not deliver all the answers we might like, it does improve the quality of the questions we can ask about how social change comes about, what its effects are and where it is leading us.</p><p>TREVOR NOBLE taught sociology at the University of Sheffield for many years.

Students learn to view a firm through its financial statements and to carry out the appropriate financial statement analysis to value the firm&#39;s debt and equity. The book takes an activist approach to investing, showing how the analyst challenges the current market price of a share by analyzing the fundamentals. With a careful assessment of accounting quality, accounting comes to life as it is integrated with the modern theory of finance to develop practical analysis and valuation tools for active investing.</p><p>Stephen Penman is the George O.

In this remarkable achievement, F. Scott Fitzgerald displays his unparalleled wit and keen social insight in his portrayal of college life through the struggles and doubts of Amory Blaine, a self-proclaimed genius with a love of knowledge and a penchant for the romantic. As Amory journeys into adulthood and leaves the aristocratic egotism of his youth behind, he becomes painfully aware of his lost innocence and the new sense of responsibility and regret that has taken its place. <br>Clever and wonderfully written, This Side of Paradise is a fascinating novel about the changes of the Jazz Age and their effects on the individual. It is a complex portrait of a versatile mind in a restless generation that reveals rich ideas crucial to an understanding of the 1920s and timeless truths about the human need for--and fear of--change. <br>"A very enlivening book indeed, a book really brilliant and glamorous, making as agreeable reading as could be asked . . . There are clever things, keen and searching things, amusingly young and mistaken things, beautiful things and pretty things . . . and truly inspired and elevated things, an astonishing abundance of each, in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. You could call it the youthful Byronism that is normal in a man of the author's type, working out through a well-furnished intellect of unusual critical force."<br>--The Evening Post, 1920<br>"An astonishing and refreshing book . . . Mr. Fitzgerald has recorded with a good deal of felicity and a disarming frankness the adventures and developments of a curious and fortunate American youth. . . . [It is] delightful and encouraging to find a novel which gives us in the accurate terms of intellectual honesty a reflection of American undergraduate life. At last the revelation has come. We have the constant young American occupation--the 'petting party'--frankly and humorously in our literature."<br>--The New Republic, 1920</p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>Ultimate German: Basic-Intermediate Coursebook (LL(R) Ultimate Basic-Intermed)</h2><p>Learn German with the most comprehensive, up-to-date text available!<br><br>Developed by the experts at Living Language, this book offers a highly effective combination of conversational German with grammar and culture.

Long known and respected as a tightly integrated, clear, higher-level text, <i>Managing Human Resources</i> (11th Edition) presents strong organizing themes: teams, diversity, global issues, corporate social responsibility/ethics/sustainability, and metrics/analytics. These themes are highlighted in interesting boxed features throughout the 11th edition. The text also follows an organizational structure that emphasizes the HR Triad (employee, line manager, HR manager) with the understanding that effective human resource management requires mutual understanding and collaboration among HR professionals, managers, and all other employees. New to the 11th edition is an emphasis on preparation for the PHR/SPHR certification exam. Because organizations differ from each other in so many ways--including their locations, competitive strategies, products and services, and corporate cultures--these experienced authors use many different companies to illustrate how employers address the challenge of managing human resources effectively. This new edition includes examples of companies in many different industries, sizes, and countries.

Finding the contemporary urban scene too complex to be captured by radical or conventional approaches, Kian Tajbakhsh offers a threefold, interdisciplinary approach linking agency, space, and structure. First, he says, urban identities cannot be understood through individualistic, communitarian, or class perspectives but rather through the shifting spectrum of cultural, political, and economic influences. Second, the layered, unfinished city spaces we inhabit and within which we create meaning are best represented not by the image of bounded physical spaces but rather by overlapping and shifting boundaries. And third, the macro forces shaping urban society include bureaucratic and governmental interventions not captured by a purely economic paradigm.<br><br>Tajbakhsh examines these dimensions in the work of three major critical urban theorists of recent decades: Manuel Castells, David Harvey, and Ira Katznelson. He shows why the answers offered by Marxian urban theory to the questions of identity, space, and structure are unsatisfactory and why the perspectives of other intellectual traditions such as poststructuralism, feminism, Habermasian Critical Theory, and pragmatism can help us better understand the challenges facing contemporary cities.</p><p>"An outstanding contribution to urban scholarship. . . . [Tajbakhsh] moves us beyond essentialist views of cities as simple arenas of class struggle to a more complex and nuanced view of cities as spaces for encounters with difference and otherness and, as such, sites that transform the meanings of actors' identities."&#x2015;Michael Peter Smith, author of <i>City, State, and Market</i> <br><br>"I am sure this book will be influential in shaping the discourse on urban social theory in the near future."&#x2015;Tridib Banerjee, coauthor of <i>Urban Design Downtown</i> <br><br>"In this ambitious work, Kian Tajbakhsh addresses the fundamental issues confronting urban theory today. His aim is no less than to reconcile concepts of structure and identity within the contemporary city. Using the analytic frames of spacing and hybridity, he advances our theoretical knowledge of the multiple, overlapping fields that constitute urban life. Everyone seeking to understand the socio-spatial dialectic through which urbanism is constituted will benefit from the insights of this book." &#x2015;Susan S.

In an era when global society and the transnational market are trendy concepts, she suggests that state capacities for domestic transformative strategies provide a competitive advantage. Some of the most successful economies rely on state-informed and state-embedded institutions for governing the economy. In fact, she contends, the strength of external economic pressures is largely determined domestically, and the effect of such pressures varies with the strength of domestic institutions.Weiss analyzes the sources and varieties of state capacity for governing industrial transformation in contemporary cases: the unraveling of Sweden&#39;s distributive model of adjustment, the evolution of developmental states in Northeast Asia, and the parallel strengths of the German and Japanese systems of industrial coordination. Her comparative perspective allows her to show how different types of state capacity affect industrial vitality and domestic adjustment to global forces. As economic integration proceeds, she concludes, state capabilities will matter more rather than less in fostering social well-being and the creation of wealth.</p><p><p>Linda Weiss is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Politics at the University of Sydney. She is the author of <em>The Myth of the Powerless State</em>, also from Cornell, and coeditor most recently of <em>Developmental Politics in Transition: The Neoliberal Era and Beyond</em>.</p>"Linda Weiss shows that enthusiasm for this global market concept exceeds the evidence and is not supported by the magnitude and patterns of change in trade, production, and investment data. . . . The author reveals that states do not have general capacities but rather strengths in particular arenas. She presents an in-depth comparative study of capitalism and state capacity for Japan and the NICs, Sweden, and Germany, with lessons for others, showing why some states are better at transformative strategies than others. . . .

Cyr, Orbis, Spring 2001<br><br>"Linda Weiss opens her insightful book with the chapter title 'The State is Dead: Long Live the State.'. . . . . . The book presents many fascinating specific national measures to secure economic growth. . . A rare critique of the right-wing ideological assault on regulatory regimes. . . Weiss' larger thesis challenging the idea of an obsolete nation-state in an internationalized economic world is one that labor audiences should address."&#x2015;Robert Bruno, University of Illinois. Labor Studies Journal, Summer 2000<br><br>"The most important contribution of The Myth of the Powerless State lies in the way it puts the state back into the frame for political economy&#x2015;a welcome antidote to the neglect or denial of the state in much current literature."&#x2015;Matt Davies, Pennsylvania State University. Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 32, 2000<br><br>"This is a splendid study in political economy. Weiss uses the comparison between East Asia, Sweden and Germany as the basis for a theoretical analysis of the role of the state as a coordinator and steerer of industrial upgrading. Her style is punchy, her argument is original. Future research will have to take The Myth of the Powerless State as a point of reference."&#x2015;Robert Wade, Russell Sage Foundation, New York<br><br>"I can unreservedly recommend this book as easily the most intelligent, best-researched and original account available of the relations between states and capitalist economies in the advanced North. Linda Weiss's careful dissections of economic policies and performance in Japan and East Asia, Sweden, Germany, Britain and the United States demolish most conventional generalizations deriving from neo-liberal, 'globalization' or social democratic theories alike. This is macro-sociology of the highest quality."&#x2015;Michael Mann, University of California, Los Angeles</p><h2>Bioethics: A Primer for Christians</h2><p>Meilander explores from a Christian standpoint questions related to such issues as assisted reproduction, abortion, gene therapy, prenatal screening, euthanasia, organ donation and other bioethical matters.</p><p>Gilbert Meilaender is Phyllis and Richard Duesenberg Professor of Christian Ethics at Valparaiso University in Indiana and a member of the President&#x2019;s Council on Bioethics. His many other books includeWriting as a Christian for Christians, Meilaender (religion, Oberlin Coll.) ponders the ramifications of contemporary biotechnology. He offers "reasons of concern" rather than a full-blown attack, based on the Christian conception of the human being and the traditional respect for the body. He seeks to examine the implications of different technologies and capabilities of the medical profession that raise, for him, grave questions. While directed to Christians, the points he raises have a wider validity, and his style is pleasing and generally accessible. In reflections tinged with a traditional Judeo-Chistian viewpoint, Fiedler (English, SUNY-Buffalo) writes more as a humanist. The author of over 20 books of essays in the humanities, he rebels against the demystification and desacralization that has governed medical sciences. In his idiosyncratic style, which will not appeal to all, Fiedler berates the prejudice against the disabled and those not seen as normal and abhors euphemisms such as "nonviable terata," said of infants so malformed they are unlikely to survive. In essays addressed mostly to specialists, Fiedler ponders such points as why organ transplant programs do not succeed, the image of the doctor and the nurse in literature and popular culture, the obsession with "normal" children, and the abnormal fear of abnormality. Both authors ponder the mystery of human life; both have a healthy respect for science but also a healthy disdain for technology as an end in itself. Theirs are clarion calls for a more circumspect examination of current medical procedures that allow us to prolong life, end the life of the unwanted, and cure the problems of those who are not "normal."

Cobb takes a fresh approach to science for young children in the Science Play series. Each book introduces a single, simple concept through words, pictures, and experimentation (or as the series title would have it, "play"). Indeed, Cobb encourages adults reading the book aloud to put the book aside whenever an activity is suggested and let the child explore and discover before continuing reading. The bold graphics feature strong, simplified forms, colors, and patterns as well as the creative use of typography to represent, say, the path of a bouncing beam of light or the shape of a drop of water dripping from a faucet. In <i>I Get Wet</i>, a boy learns some of the properties of water through pouring it into different containers, observing it drip and flow, and trying to absorb it with waxed paper and paper toweling. <i>I See Myself</i> features a girl who finds out a little about vision, light, and reflection by playing with a mirror, a flashlight, and a bouncing ball. The crisp, upbeat look of the digital illustrations contrasts sharply with the often posed and tired-looking photographs routinely used in books of science experiments for young children. This playful approach reflects the enthusiastic tone in Cobb's text, which encourages children to discover for themselves the properties of water and light. An eye-opening debut for a promising series. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Presents the original text of Shakespeare&#39;s play side by side with a modern version, discusses the author and the theater of his time, and provides quizzes and other study activities.</p><p><b>William Shakespeare</b>&nbsp;(1564&#x2013;1616)&nbsp;was a&nbsp;poet,&nbsp;playwright, and actor who is widely regarded as one of the most&nbsp;influential writers in the history of the English language. Often referred to as the Bard of Avon, Shakespeare's vast body of work includes&nbsp;comedic, tragic, and historical plays;&nbsp;poems; and 154 sonnets.&nbsp;His dramatic works have been translated into every major language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br><br><b>Bethan Janine</b> is a designer and illustrator based in the UK. Her bright, patterned designs, inspired by the natural world, have been sought by clients across the globe in the fashion, textile, editorial, and packaging businesses.&nbsp;Her books include <i>Coloring for Moms and Moms-to-Be</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet: A Coloring Classic</i>.<br><br><b>Renia Metallinou </b>is an illustrator and designer. She lives in Greece with her husband and family.Grade 4-8&#x2013;This timeless tale is retold in clear prose interspersed with quoted dialogue, italicized for easy identification. The well-known elements are here: the feuding families; the love-at-first-sight encounter of the protagonists; their passionate-if-short-lived romance; and the reconciliation brought about by the teens' tragic deaths. Although the text generally flows smoothly, there are problems. Romeo's bemoaning his unrequited love of Rosaline is never mentioned, eliminating the whole premise of him easily transferring his passion from one girl to another. While the language generally suggests the poetry of the original verse, (e.g., she knew the breath of love), some of the phrases are oversimplified or too modern in tone. For example, a hotheaded Tybalt mutters, Just you wait....You'll pay for this. Later, when Romeo confesses his feelings for Juliet to Friar Laurence, the priest never attempts to urge him to go slowly, as he does in Shakespeare's play. Set in a wash of sepia tones that suggest the rich colors of old Verona, Unzner's watercolor-and-pen illustrations are well executed; however, her technique of overlaying subsidiary characters in penned sketches gives the artwork a somewhat cluttered and unfinished appearance. Furthermore, the quotes that are incorporated into the pictures are often difficult to read and distracting. While Kindermann's accessible version will appeal to a younger and less sophisticated audience than Bruce Coville's version (Dial, 1999), it will not replace his exquisite retelling.<i>&#x2013;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Other than the name, we have no biographical details of Cynewulf, not even the most basic facts of where or when he lived. Yet the poems themselves attest to a powerfully inventive imagination, deeply learned in Christian doctrine and traditional verse-craft.</p><p>Runic letters spelling out the name Cynewulf appear in four poems: <i>Christ II</i> (or <i>The Ascension</i>), <i>Juliana,</i> <i>The Fates of the Apostles,</i> and <i>Elene.</i> To these a fifth can be added, <i>Guthlac B</i> because of similarities in style and vocabulary, but any signature (if one ever existed) has been lost because its ending lines are missing. What characterizes Cynewulf&#x2019;s poetry? He reveals an expert control of structure as shown from the changes he makes to his Latin sources. He has a flair for extended similes and dramatic dialogue. In <i>Christ II,</i> for example, the major events in Christ's life are portrayed as vigorous leaps. In <i>Juliana</i> the force of the saint&#x2019;s rhetoric utterly confounds a demon sent to torment her.</p></p><p><p>A Fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, Robert E.

In this third edition of their popular book, Student Achievement Through Staff Development, the authors offer an expanded guide to making that prediction a reality. </p><p>Through case studies of successful programs, evidence from research, and illustrations from their extensive experience, Joyce and Showers help educators design programs that measurably improve student achievement. They fill the gaps in staff development programs by answering vexing questions from both teachers and administrators: </p><p>* How can we develop the skill to implement new curricular and instructional knowledge? <br>* How can we embed the study of student learning into staff development? <br>* How can we adapt learning environments to meet individual needs? </p><p>The focus of the book is on the potential for both personal and organizational growth inherent in staff development programs. School renewal ultimately depends on the individual development of all its members. Joyce and Showers lead the way to creating a community in which organizers, providers, teachers, administrators, and students learn and grow together to achieve the goal of lasting student achievement.</p></p><p>Bruce Joyce grew up in New Jersey, was educated at Brown University, and, after military service, taught in the schools of Delaware. He was a professor at the University of Delaware, the University of Chicago, and Teachers College, Columbia University, where he directed the laboratory school and the elementary teacher education program.

With us there's a saying, "La esperenza muera ultima. Hope dies last." You can't lose hope. If you lose hope, you lose everything.</i>Jessie de la Cruz, retired farm worker Studs Terkel's marvelous oral histories have hitherto dealt with specifics, as he puts it "the visceral stuff the job, race, age and death." While Terkel's chosen theme here, the incandescence of hope, might at first appear elusive, it is anything but abstract. For Terkel, hope is born of activism, commitment, and the steely determination to resist. The spirit of activism has ebbed and flooded through Terkel's venerable life. In the Great Depression of the 1930s he recalls a man swinging from a chandelier at the Astor Hotel shouting for "Social Security!" In the 1960s it was African Americans and students who advocated for equal rights and an end to maladventure overseas. And now, in a new century, young and old are joining forces on the streets to say no to war. The spark of activism is igniting the precious idea of a better world once again. The interviews in <i>Hope Dies Last</i> constitute an alternative history of the "American century," forming a legacy of the indefatigable spirit that Studs has always embodied, and an inheritance for those who, by taking a stand, are making concrete the dreams of today.</p><p>While American military forces seek to defeat an enemy that has no nation and American citizens ponder a future inextricably linked to the threat of terrorism, legendary writer Studs Terkel steps forward with a remarkable volume of oral histories that sheds new light on fighting for a just cause in uncertain times. As the title of <i>Hope Dies Last</i> suggests, Terkel's interviews all deal with the notion of finding hope in difficult times and holding on to that hope (of a better job, a better life, justice, peace) despite often overwhelming odds. Terkel draws his subjects from an incredibly broad range of backgrounds: pardoned Illinois death row inmate Leroy Orange discusses the events of his life, 94-year-old famed economist John Kenneth Galbraith talks about Enron, undocumented Guatemalans tell of trying to merely survive in modern America. While each testimonial is compelling in its own way, they combine to form a mosaic of human tenacity. Often, as in the case of 1960s civil rights activists, the subjects' ideas are accepted in the long run, for others, including a resident of Chicago's Cabrini Green housing project, the struggle is only just beginning. Terkel, 91 years old at the time of this book's publication, draws from a wealth of human experience but is spry enough to take on new causes and skillfully profile youthful activists with emerging causes. And <i>Hope Dies Last</i> is still a Studs Terkel book, full of the Pulitzer Prize-winning author's brand of blue-collar, rabble-rousing, union-card-waving brand of broad shouldered Chicago liberalism that makes the current wave of political writers seem a bit green and petty by comparison. For all of their success in selling books that accuse one another of being liars and idiots, those writers would do well to get out and meet even a few of the people that Studs Terkel has been talking to for years. <i>--John Moe</i><b>Studs Terkel</b> is the author of ten books of oral history, including <i>Working</i> and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>"The Good War."</i></p><h2>Legal Issues in Child Abuse and Neglect (Interpersonal Violence: The Practice Series)</h2><p>Professionals from social work, psychology, nursing, medicine and related disciplines are increasingly being confronted by issues of law in their interaction with abused and neglected children.

As Lynn's apprentice, Jennifer learns to strip away the delusions accumulated through a lifetime of social and personal conditioning.

The results are startling and uncomfortable, poignant and inspiring.<br>Apprentice to Power also shows how Jennifer takes the shamanic practices learned in her work with Lynn and translates them into her own transformational work with clients.</p><p>A family therapist who combines traditional and shamanic principles in her healing therapies, Morse here offers her life teachings as example, inspiration, and instruction. Though she was already a trained therapist, it was only under the guidance of prolific author and shaman Lynn Andrews that Morse journeyed from the powerlessness of an abusive relationship to a state of spiritual enlightenment. Now, when observing her patients, Morse is able to see her own life mirrored in theirs. Here she recommends the use of ceremonies as well as prayer as important tools in the healing process. Part of one ceremony, for example, includes making an anger doll and a grief doll to dissipate emotions.

I've been called apostate, vigilante, and crazy bitch, and maybe I am. But some people call me a hero, and I'd like to think they're right too. If I am a hero, maybe it's because every time I can play a part in saving a child or a woman from a life of servitude and degradation, I'm saving a little piece of me, too.</p> <p>I was one of twenty-eight children born to my dad and his three wives. Indoctrinated to believe that the outside world was evil, and that I resided among the righteous, I was destined to marry a man chosen for me by the Prophet. I would then live in harmony with my sister-wives, bear many children, and obey and serve my future husband in this life and throughout eternity. But my innocence didn't last long. While still a child, I understood that the church of the righteous was nothing but a church of lies.</p> <p>When I was eight years old my father sexually molested me for the first time, raping me when I was twelve. I tried to kill myself. Beaten, molested, taunted, and abused by family members alleging they only wanted to save my soul became a daily routine, I ran from this abuse more than once in my early teens--even attempting to cross the desert on foot. My family hunted me down. I thought government agencies would provide me safety if I reported my father. Instead, police and social services colluded with the FLDS to return me to my family and I ended up back inside polygamy, right where I started."</p> <p>Flora goes on from there to tell the dramatic true story of how she ultimately escaped and has been fighting against frustrating obstacles with hard fought successes in rescuing women and children from the FLDS. It's a story you can't put down.</p></p><p><b>Praise for <i>Church of Lies</i></b> <p>"Flora Jessop's story is raw, courageous, riveting, and a real eye-opener. Once you start reading, you can't put it down. Church of Lies is one more compelling reason why polygamy should not be decriminalized."<br> &#x2014;<b>John R. Llewellyn,</b> author, <i>Polygamy's Rape of Rachael Strong: Protected Environment for Predators</i></p> <p>"This is an important book that sheds light on an ultra-authoritarian secretive community in our midst. Flora Jessop spares no punches in telling her story and describing life in the FLDS, especially the hazards for women and children. But no matter how cruel and oppressive the setting, Jessop was able to break free and help others do the same. A must-read for anyone interested in children's rights, victims' rights, and just plain human decency."<br> &#x2014;<b>Janja Lalich,</b> PhD, author, <i>Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships</i>; coauthor with Margaret Singer, <i>Cults in our Midst</i></p> <p>"Risking her life, Flora Jessop has become a folk hero for her defense of countless victims of abuses perpetrated within the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints community. Her own struggle to free herself of its constraints is remarkable; her advocacy for those who are attempting to leave is inspirational."<br> &#x2014;<b>Dr. Stephen A. Kent,</b> professor, Department of Sociology andInterdisciplinary Program in Religious Studies, University of Alberta</p> <p>"Alternating between grit and childlike innocence, Flora Jessop's story is both difficult to read and impossible to put down. She reveals the truth about the secret fundamentalist Mormon FLDS for all to see and skillfully exposes the real dangers that lurk within this twisted religious system."<br> &#x2014;<b>Natalie R. Collins,</b> author, <i>Wives and Sisters and Behind Closed Doors</i></p><p>Church of Lies</p> <p>"My name is Flora Jessop. I've been called apostate, vigilante, and crazy bitch, and maybe I am. But some people call me a hero, and I'd like to think they're right too. If I am a hero, maybe it's because . . . every time I can play a part in saving a child or a woman from a life of servitude and degradation, I'm saving a little piece of me, too."&#x2014;From the Introduction</p> <p>Church of Lies is a stranger-than-fiction story that is torn from today's headlines. It recounts Flora Jessop's painful journey: she was held captive and repeatedly abused, both physically and sexually, only to flee her "family" and find herself addicted to drugs, working as a topless dancer, and involved with violent men. Ultimately, her story is one of redemption. Flora had an awakening that led her to become an outspoken advocate for women and children who are still suffering in polygamist communities.</p> <p>Church of Lies not only tells the heartbreaking personal story of a courageous woman but also exposes the FLDS for what it is&#x2014;a renegade and abusive cult. Flora says it this way:</p> <p>"I understood that there were others beside myself who needed help&#x2014;thousands of children and women were suffering in polygamy, just as I had. Condemned to a life of ignorance, brainwashing, and brutality; treated like property; producing as many as sixteen children; dying prematurely, all used up . . . I was so damn mad, I decided I would spend the rest of my life saving every last one of them. Rescuing a teenager from polygamy is like taking someone straight from hell and delivering her to heaven. So far, I've saved a few. But I'm far from done with my journey."</p></p><h2>Keyboard For Dummies</h2><p><b>The easy way to get keyed up on the keyboard</b> <p>Where <i>Piano For Dummies</i> helps budding musicians to master the black-and-white musical keyboard, <i>Keyboard For Dummies</i> helps them understand the possibilities that unfold when those black-and-whites are connected to state-of-the-art music technology.</p> <p><i>Keyboard For Dummies</i> explains the ins-and-outs of modern keyboards and helps you get the most out of their capabilities.

Linda Stratmann&#x2019;s dark and splendid social history reveals the nineteenth century as a gruesome battleground where poisoners went head-to-head with authorities who strove to detect poisons, control their availability, and bring the guilty to justice. She corrects many misconceptions about particular poisons and documents how the evolution of issues such as marital rights and the legal protection of children impacted poisonings. Combining archival research with a novelist&#x2019;s eye, Stratmann charts the era&#x2019;s inexorable rise of poison cases both shocking and sad.</p><p><b>Linda Stratmann</b> is the author of several nonfiction books, including <i>The Marquess of Queensberry</i>.&#x201c;Poisoning, Linda Stratmann makes clear in this extravagantly detailed history, was one of the great fears of the 19th century...

Its core artworks consist of sculptures from all major regions of Nigeria, and interesting examples of Edo/Benin bronze and brass sculptures from the late dynastic and twentieth century interregnum periods of Benin art. The book uses the diversity, styles and originality of these artworks to evaluate the material process of formalizing and interpreting an African-owned collection of African art. Publications focusing on African collectors of African art are very rare and this limits our understanding of how Africans engage with indigenous art and cultural production, or questions about cultural patrimony, in their own contexts. The analysis of this unique collection provides a significant insight into an unexplored aspect of African art collections and the role and relevance of African collectors in shaping the discourse on this art.</p><p>Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie is Associate Professor of Art history, University of California Santa Barbara.

From the moment he stepped onto the court of the Boston Garden in 1956, Russell began to transform the sport in a fundamental way, making him, more than any of his contemporaries, the Jackie Robinson of basketball. In <i>King of the Court</i>, Aram Goudsouzian provides a vivid and engrossing chronicle of the life and career of this brilliant champion and courageous racial pioneer. Russell&#x2019;s leaping, wide-ranging defense altered the game&#x2019;s texture. His teams provided models of racial integration in the 1950s and 1960s, and, in 1966, he became the first black coach of any major professional team sport. Yet, like no athlete before him, Russell challenged the politics of sport. Instead of displaying appreciative deference, he decried racist institutions, embraced his African roots, and challenged the nonviolent tenets of the civil rights movement. This beautifully written book&#x2015;sophisticated, nuanced, and insightful&#x2015;reveals a singular individual who expressed the dreams of Martin Luther King Jr. while echoing the warnings of Malcolm X.</p><p>"<i>King of the Court</i> provides a highly nuanced and sophisticated analysis of the great African American basketball player from his earliest days up to the present time. With great skill and much insight, Goudsouzian makes clear that Russell was a very complicated man who was full of contradictions in his own private life and in relationship to his business associates, teammates, opponents, the media, and the larger sporting public."&#x2015;David K.Wiggins, George Mason University<br><br>"Not only is <i>King of the Court</i> one of the most impressive and important sports biographies to come along in many a season, easily in the same class as David Maraniss's When Pride Still Mattered (on Vince Lombardi) and Wil Haygood's Sweet Thunder (on Sugar Ray Robinson), it is also one of the truly incisive books on the intersection of race, civil rights, and popular culture that have appeared in some time. Having grown up in Philadelphia, I was always a Wilt Chamberlain man and always will be, but <i>King of the Court</i> convinced me that Bill Russell defined his age in ways that Chamberlain never did. Russell was a man for all seasons. This is a biography befitting Russell's stature."&#x2015;Gerald Early, author of <i>One Nation Under a Groove: Motown and American Culture</i><br><br>"Before there were crossover dribbles or slam dunk competitions, before they even kept statistics for blocked shots, Bill Russell dominated the game we call basketball. The respect he demanded as a black man during America's turbulent Civil Rights era made him the personification of a winner in life. <i>King of the Court</i>, like Russell's defense, locks it down, and puts it all in its proper context. Long live the King!"&#x2015;Dr. Todd Boyd, author of <i>Young, Black, Rich, and Famous: The Rise of the NBA, the Hip Hop Invasion, and the Transformation of American Culture</i><br><br>"Bill Russell's life story is only incidentally about basketball. For him the sport was not a life; it was his vehicle for social change, a platform that showcased his vision for America as much as his athletic talent. In his magnificent biography, Aram Goudsouzian captures the nuance and meaning of Russell's career. After reading the book, one will never look at Russell or sports in quite the same way."&#x2015;Randy Roberts, Purdue University<br><br>"Brings back the excitement of the great days of the NBA and its legendary players, led by the king of them all, Bill Russell.

Computer scientists have identified many techniques that a wide range of programs need, such as:</p><ul><li>Fuzzy pattern matching for text (identify misspellings!)</li><li>Finding correlations in data</li><li>Game-playing algorithms</li><li>Predicting phenomena such as Web traffic</li><li>Polynomial and spline fitting</li></ul>Using algorithms explained in this book, you too can carry out traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient, easy-to-maintain manner with Perl.This book assumes a basic understanding of Perl syntax and functions, but not necessarily any background in computer science. The authors explain in a readable fashion the reasons for using various classic programming techniques, the kind of applications that use them, and -- most important -- how to code these algorithms in Perl.If you are an amateur programmer, this book will fill you in on the essential algorithms you need to solve problems like an expert. If you have already learned algorithms in other languages, you will be surprised at how much different (and often easier) it is to implement them in Perl. And yes, the book even has the obligatory fractal display program.There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, some of them excellent, but never before has there been one that uses Perl.<b>The authors include the editor of <i>The Perl Journal</i> and master librarian of CPAN; all are contributors to CPAN and have archived much of the code in this book there.</b>"This book was so exciting I lost sleep reading it." Tom Christiansen</p><p>Written for readers with at least some Perl programming experience, <i>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</i> delivers a solid library of algorithms written in Perl for business and mathematical computing. From data structures to cryptography and more advanced mathematical algorithms, this book provides a worthwhile guide to extending Perl's coding capabilities.<p> The best thing about <i>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</i> is the scope at which it covers the universe of algorithms while refraining from getting bogged down in academic detail. Besides basic data structures--a lynchpin of books on algorithms--the authors provide dozens and dozens of algorithms for sorting, searching, and doing mathematical computations of all kinds. While they discuss "Big-O" notation and assume a general familiarity with math, they don't overwhelm the reader. (You can even borrow the code without needing a math degree to understand it.) The focus is on efficient, reusable Perl subroutines written and compiled by three Perl experts.</p><p> Standout chapters include extending Perl's already powerful string processing abilities, game programming, and cryptography. Generally, the authors achieve a good mix of more advanced (and less well-known) algorithms, along with the basics. Chances are you won't need to use all the dozen or so sorting algorithms presented here, but the authors include them all, just in case. As a reference and tutorial, readers can pick and choose what they need for real-world Perl development.</p><p> There hasn't been a book dedicated exclusively to Perl algorithms prior to the publication of this one. In all, <i>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</i> fills a useful niche by compiling a powerful library of Perl algorithms that will be useful for anyone who works with this programming language, whether in business or academic computing. <i>--Richard Dragan</i> </p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Perl data types, Big-O notation, data structures, queues, deques, linked lists, binary trees, sorting and searching algorithms, game and dynamic programming, sets and multisets, matrices and graphs, string matching and parsing, 2-D geometry, number systems, cryptography (including DES and RSA), probability, statistics, and numerical analysis.</p><p>Jarkko Hietaniemi is the creator and Master Librarian of CPAN: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

Practical Homicide Investigation Inc, New York, USA,&#34;[A] must-have if you frequently deal with criminal defense work, an excellent primer on homicide investigation . Geberth, a retired Lt. Commander of the New York City Police Department, has produced what may be the finest, most detailed guide for homicide investigators ever written, and almost every chapter has been updated for this new edition to reflect the ever-changing technology .&#34; - PI Magazine, Sept./Oct. 2004 &#34;[T]he result of [the author&#39;s] endeavors is a book which is in the first place, so easy to read, but secondly so cleverly constructed as to both inform the reader but also to be so available as a reference manual. I found it extremely readable [T]he information conveyed is very explicit. The themes are well illustrated either by case reports or by photographic images and these aides are clearly presented without distracting from the impact of the text. I feel that it is a very valuable addition to any library interested in assisting in Forensic Medicine, no matter in which discipline. I would commend it as a very readable, well set out volume which I am sure would prove its use in many instances.&#34; - Dr. William P. Ryan, O.A.M. Quotes to use as needed: &#34;Using his personal experience and a network of professionals, Geberth has compiled, in one resource, a book that covers every imaginable aspect of homicide investigation, offering guidance for most circumstances encountered during investigations. ... This is an excellent and relevant text that far surpasses anything available to the profession today.&#34; -Robert C. Shaler, Ph.D., Department of Health, Office of Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York &#34;Vern Geberth doesn&#39;t tell you about a homicide scene. He puts you in themiddle of it. You see it. You feel it. You smell it. You hear it. You live it. His third edition is the best yet.&#34; -Larry Welch, Director, Kansas Bureau of Investigation &#34;As a practitioner myself, I highly recommend the book to all law enforcement personnel who are involved in the investigation of homicides.&#34; -Edward J. McNelley, Captain Detective, Boston Police Department &#34;This third edition... is the classic from which all other books on this topic will be rated. Simply put, this book provides the information today&#39;s investigators need. No other book comes close.&#34; -Bruce Cameron, Editorial Director, Law and Order &#34;This is an incredible piece of work written in practical terms.... This truly is the ultimate resource for death scene investigation!&#34; -Richard Holden, Training Officer, Brooklyn Park Police &#34;Geberth has succeeded in accomplishing the gargantuan task of revising this book, which is extensive in its scope and breadth, covering practically every circumstance and providing valuable pearls throughout.&#34; -Frederick T. Zugibe, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Rockland County, New York &#34;The most comprehensive publication ever written on homicide investigation.&#34; -Captain Thomas Nye, Warwick Police Department, Rhode Island, and Executive Director, Northeast Law Enforcement Officers Association &#34;I believe that the extent of Geberth&#39;s knowledge of all aspects of homicide investigations is unmatched anywhere in the world, and this third edition is testimony to this knowledge.&#34; -Captain Thomas J. Cronin, Chicago Police Department &#34;The combination of [Practical Homicide Investigation, Third Edition] and the new Practical Homicide Investigation Checklist and Field Guide makes this themost complete manual on homicide investigations in the country. It should not only be mandatory reading for new investigators, but it is a great reference manual for even the most seasoned homicide investigator. This is a must for every investigator and belongs in every homicide office.&#34; -Jerry Keller, Sheriff, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department &#34;As a Deputy Chief with forty years&#39; experience, I am convinced that this book is an absolute must-read for all homicide investigators. It should also be studied by all law enforcement professionals who want a clear, concise, detailed guide to the investigation of homicides.&#34; Lt. Colonel James J.

Presenting a broad view of art through the centuries, it sympathetically and positively introduces the works of all artists. This includes women, artists of color, and the arts of other continents and regions, as well as those of Western Europe and the United States. The new edition contains even more full-color reproductions, larger images, redrawn maps and timelines, and new photographs and higher quality images. Balancing both the traditions of art history and new trends of the present, Art History is the most comprehensive, accessible, and magnificently illustrated work of its kind. Broad in scope and depth, this beautifully illustrated work features art from the following time periods and places: prehistoric art in Europe; ancient art of the Near East, Egypt, the Aegean, and Greece; Roman and Etruscan art; Jewish, early Ch</p><p>This attractively packaged two-volume set attempts an almost impossible task: to present the art of the entire world, from vibrant cave paintings dating back 30,000 years to the creative trends of the late 20th century. Though the arts of Europe are the most thoroughly analyzed, respected scholars in several specialized fields cover other cultures with cogent essays. A more unusual feature is the space devoted to art created by women, such as the late-Renaissance painters Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia Fontana--the latter was invited in 1560 to be an official painter at the Spanish court. Relationships between the art of different cultures are emphasized and, while each section can stand alone, each is shown to fit meaningfully into the overall development of the world's artistic heritage. Beautiful images grace the production's 1,200 pages, not only well-known icons but a wealth of lesser-known gems are here, carefully chosen to demonstrate the points made in the text. There are many delightful surprises among the illustrations, many of which are in color, printed to high quality standards in Japan. For instance, line drawings explain technical details, from "Lost-wax Bronze-casting" to "Elements of the Skyscraper." A vast amount of information is presented, but it is very well organized and easy to access, and an extensive glossary answers many questions. Marilyn Stokstad's <i>Art History</i> is a true tour de force, and its light and humanistic approach is a refreshing change from previous encyclopedic art-historical studies. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Marilyn Stokstad&#39;s Art History is the art history text for a new generation of teachers and students. Presenting a global view of art through the centuries, Art History introduces the beginning student in a positive and sympathetic manner to the works of all artists including women and artists of color, and to the arts of other continents and regions in addition to those of Western Europe and the United States.

Part I of this book follows the development of quantum field theory for point particles, while Part II introduces strings. All of the tools and concepts that are needed to quantize strings are developed first for point particles. Thus, Part I presents the main framework of quantum field theory and provides for a coherent development of the generalization and application of quantum field theory for point particles to strings.Part II emphasizes the quantization of the bosonic string. The treatment is most detailed in the path integral representation where the object of interest, the partition function, is a sum over random surfaces. The relevant mathematics of Riemann surfaces is covered. Superstrings are briefly introduced, and the sum over genus 0 supersurfaces is computed.The emphasis of the book is calculational, and most computations are presented in step-by-step deta</p><p><b>Brian Hatfield</b> is co-founder and senior research physicist at AMP Research in Lexington, Massachusetts.

A study of Sarah Lucas's famous assemblage of objects that suggest male and female body parts.</b></p><p>Amna Malik opens her study of Sarah Lucas's <i>Au Naturel</i> (1994) by asking &#x201c;Does art have a sex? And if so, what does it look like?&#x201d; <i>Au Naturel </i>is an assemblage of objects&#x2015;a mattress, a bucket, a pair of melons, oranges and a cucumber&#x2015;that suggest male and female body parts. Through much of Lucas's work, and particularly through <i>Au Naturel</i>, Malik argues, we are placed in a position of spectatorship that makes us see &#x201c;sex&#x201d; as so many dismembered parts, with no apparent morality attached&#x2015;no implication of guilt, shame, or embarrassment. The sardonic and irreverent nature of Lucas's observations, moreover, violates certain assumptions about what kind of art women artists make. This, Malik proposes, is the significance of Lucas's work for a later generation of artists who are unburdened by the need to insist on questions of gender and sexual politics as a necessary subject for the woman artist. Lucas's shift between high and low art and culture operates as a shift between &#x201c;high&#x201d; aesthetic ideas about the art object as a metaphoric play of meaning and its &#x201c;low&#x201d; associations with the materiality of the literal object and its allusions to the genitals and sex. <i>Au Naturel</i> creates a series of associations that bring the ideal into collision with a base materialism emphasizing desire as a condition of the meaning of the object.</p></p><p>Amna Malik is a Lecturer in Art History and Theory at the Slade School of Fine Art, London.</p><h2>Wind Energy Explained</h2><p>This authoritative textbook is intended to provide both a thorough and highly accessible introduction to the cross-disciplinary field of wind engineering.

How did this European legal system come to be? To answer this question, Bart Wauters and Marco de Benito offer us a fresh overview of the history of law in Europe, dealing with both civil and common law, from Roman times through to its codification. This book is a stimulating, lucid, and imaginative read.'</i><br>- Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, University of Pennsylvania, US<p></p><p>Comprehensive and accessible, this book offers a concise synthesis of the evolution of the law in Western Europe, from ancient Rome to the beginning of the twentieth century. It situates law in the wider framework of Europe's political, economic, social and cultural developments. </p><p>Offering a readily graspable and sound structure, chapters are organized according to the civil law systems and common law systems. Each chapter is built around the evolution of the four sources of the law: legal science, legislation, courts and customary law, set chronologically against the relevant historical context. Throughout this in-depth presentation of the key determinants in European legal history, Bart Wauters and Marco de Benito allow readers to understand how the law arose and evolved in Europe as a shared language, of which its different national laws are but dialectal expressions - with the unique exception, perhaps, of English common law, whose peculiarity is likewise due to accidents of history which are themselves explored. </p><p>With its elegant comparative approach, this book will appeal to European Law students and scholars looking for a concise, yet academically sound, account of the history of law in Europe.</p></p><p><b>Bart Wauters</b> and <b>Marco de Benito</b>, Professors of Law, IE University, Spain<i>'Wauters and de Benito's </i>The History of Law in Europe<i> is an ideal first port of call for anybody who wants to quickly get to grips with European legal history.

Authors Kohl and Murray, both leaders in the field, offer a solid introduction to the concepts of public health and kinesiology, the techniques used to measure physical activity, and the health effects of exercise and physical activity. The scientific findings and applications that led to the emergence of the field of physical activity and public health are also examined. Students will come away with a greater understanding of how experts from both fields can work together to advance the use of physical activity for the prevention and treatment of chronic disease and other health issues. </p><p><i>Foundations of Physical Activity and Public Health </i>describes how physical activity improves health, including cardiorespiratory and metabolic diseases, overweight and obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, cancers, and mental health. Data on the prevalence and economic costs are presented to demonstrate the scope of the health issues and the importance of addressing them. Information on common testing methods, evidence on the benefits of physical activity, and recommendations for physical activity will give readers the background knowledge for promoting physical activity as a means of improving health. The health risks associated with physical activity are also discussed. Information on the prevalence of problems, the adaptive processes that can help prevent injury, and minimizing risks will prepare students to consider and address safety concerns. </p><p> The text examines evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity in individuals and populations using three general approaches: informational, behavioral and social, and environmental and policy. Examples of successful programs from various settings, including community-wide and school-based interventions, help students understand how to apply the theory to practice. Students also learn the concepts of evaluation of physical activity programs as well as logic models, evaluation designs, data collection, and analysis. In addition, building effective partnerships for physical activity programs is discussed alongside real-world initiatives such as the state plan Active Texas 2020, the U.S. National Physical Activity Plan, and the Toronto Charter for Physical Activity. Strategies and models for physical activity advocacy are also addressed. </p><p> The text features a wealth of pedagogical aids that will enhance students&#x2019; learning experience. Chapter-opening summaries and question lists detail key concepts to focus on, case studies and callout boxes provide real-world examples that tie theory to practice, and Key Leader Profile sidebars allow students to explore career options while learning more about individuals who have had a major impact on this emerging field. Each chapter ends with a review of the most important ideas covered, key terms, and study questions that will help students test their recall and develop their understanding of the material. Full bibliographies are provided as well as valuable online resource lists in the E-Media sections. For instructors, ancillaries are available to assist in teaching their courses. </p><p><i>Foundations of Physical Activity and Public Health</i> is also an asset to new professionals as well as those preparing for the ACSM/NPAS Physical Activity in Public Health Specialist certification exam. The text addresses the core competencies put forth by NPAS&#x2014;including partnership development, planning and evaluation, development of effective interventions, and evaluation of scientific data&#x2014;and is cross-referenced at the end of each chapter for easy review. </p><p> As the emphasis on physical activity as a tool for improving public health grows, the expertise of professionals with the combined knowledge and skills from both the public health science and exercise science fields will be highly sought. <i>Foundations of Physical Activity and Public Health</i> will help students obtain an overview of the kinesiology and public health areas, understand physical activity applications for public health, learn about career options, and inspire them to choose a career in the emerging field of physical activity and public health. </p></p><p><p><b>Harold W.

Already we may have found microbes in meteorites from Mars. As Parker points out, three of Jupiter&#39;s moons are now known to contain ice and liquid water - leading some scientists to believe that perhaps under this ice lie hidden areas teeming with aquatic life. After discovering planets outside our solar system, astronomers believe that other &#34;suns&#34; may exist capable of supporting planets that harbor alien life-forms. Beyond making contact, Parker stresses that disaster surely awaits us on Earth as its ever-growing population depletes our planet&#39;s natural resources. He delineates the plans to mine treasures in space, generate power on distant bodies, and establish thriving communities in space. We can control our alien searches in space, but what if they find us first? Have we already been visited? Have humanoid creatures with large black eyes actually hovered over our towns? How do we account for eyewitness reports of bizarre glowing lights, &#34;scorched&#34; patterns on crop fields, and alleged abductions? Parker investigates the truth surrounding these visits and discusses the UFO phenomenon.</p><p><b>Barry Parker, Ph.D</b>, is an award-winning science writer and the author of eleven highly acclaimed books in popular science, including <i>Alien Life, Cosmic Time Travel, Einstein's Dream</i>, and <i>Einstein's Brainchild</i>.Despite an evidently open-minded attitude, Parker delivers the hard line to ET enthusiasts in his new book: "strangely, we haven't found a single sign of life beyond our solar system." In his latest (following Chaos in the Cosmos and eight other books), the emeritus Idaho State University professor of astronomy and physics summarizes recent scientific conjecture on extraterrestrial life without venturing much personal speculation. He considers the "architecture of life" and the mystery of DNA as related to its possible exploitation elsewhere; the possibility of non-carbon-based life forms; the history of Mars exploration (including the recent "meteorite from Mars" discovery); the results of NASA space probes; the discovery of distant planets through advanced telescopy; and the SETI program's search for alien radio signals. Parker acknowledges the contentions of UFO believers, but devotes few pages to claims of alien encounters such as the well-known Roswell incident. Steering clear of that controversy as "an argument not likely to be resolved in the near future," Parker's hopeful and energetic book ends up reinforcing the science establishment's lonely outlook for humanity, but still leaves room for the possibility that if they are out there, we will find them?or they, us. 79 illustrations. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Spells: A Handbook of Magic, Charms, and Potions (Volume 2) (Mystical Handbook, 2)</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re hoping to catch that person you&#x2019;ve been secretly in love with for the past five months, or perhaps an unrequited crush is not getting your subtle hints, the one true adage is that love has no rules and sometimes needs a little help or gentle nudge.

Results teaches readers a highly effective, easy-to-learn, field tested system for assessing organizational results within three domains: performance (system and financial), learning (knowledge and expertise), and perceptions (participant and stakeholder).<br> Why measure results in HRD? Because the "corporate school" and "human relations" models of HRD practice, whereby development occurs simply because it is good for employees, no longer works. If HRD is to be a core organizational process, it must act like one and hold itself accountable. Measuring results, particularly bottom-line performance results, is key to gaining support from top management. And those who measure results ultimately find it a source of program improvement and innovation as well as pride and satisfaction.<br> While Results is theoretically sound, it is firmly rooted in practice, offering a core five-step assessment process that gives readers a simple and direct journey from analysis inputs to decision outputs. Whether they have assessment tools but no theory, theory but no tools, or no tools and no theory, this book will equip them to quickly and effectively assess their results.</p><p>Richard A.

Yet, race and ethnicity remain imprevious to many of us. Hence in this volume authors were challenged to think outside the box. As such, scholars were encouraged to dare to contemplate, to evaluate, and analyze issues regarding race and ethnicity from radically different perspectives. This critical process required them to evaluate their own assumptions and those of their respective disciplines. Therefore, much like walking a tight-rope without a net, the scholars attempt to free themselves from the disciplinarian blinders that often preclude the development of fresh insights. Collectively the papers challenge the way we conceive and perceive of race and ethnicity. As a consequence they go past the ideological constraints that normally limit such discourse by disciplinarian boundaries or disciplinarian myopia. Therefore, these papers provide a critical reappraisal of race and ethnicity.</p><p><b>Rodney D.

The theme of <em>Introduction to Genetics: A Molecular Approach</em> is therefore the progression from molecules (DNA and genes) to processes (gene expression and DNA replication) to systems (cells, organisms and populations). This progression reflects both the basic logic of life and the way in which modern biological research is structured. The molecular approach is particularly suitable for the large number of students for whom genetics is a part of a broader program in biology, biochemistry, the biomedical sciences, and biotechnology.<em> </em></p> <p><em>Introduction to Genetics</em> presents the basic facts and concepts with enough depth of knowledge to stimulate students to move on to more advanced aspects of the subject. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 examines the function of the gene as a unit of biological information. Part 2 studies the role of the gene as a unit of inheritance. And Part 3 explores some of the areas of research that are responsible for the high profile that genetics has in our modern world, from agriculture and industry to medicine and forensics, and the ethical challenges that genetic knowledge imparts. </p> <p><em>Introduction to Genetics</em> is available for purchase as an e-book in its entirety or as individual chapters, and as a 1-year or 6-month rental.</p></p><p></p><h2>debbie tucker green plays: one</h2><p>A collection of plays from award-winning playwright, screenwriter, and director debbie tucker green.</p><p>debbie tucker green is a playwright, screenwriter and director.<p><br></p><p>Her plays include:&nbsp;<em>a profoundly affectionate, passionate devotion to someone (-noun)</em>&nbsp;(Royal Court Theatre, 2017);&nbsp;<em>hang</em>&nbsp;(Royal Court, 2015);&nbsp;<em>nut</em>&nbsp;(National Theatre, 2013);&nbsp;<em>truth and reconciliation&nbsp;</em>(Royal Court, 2011);<em>random&nbsp;</em>(Royal Court, 2008);&nbsp;<em>generations</em>&nbsp;(Young Vic, 2007);&nbsp;<em>stoning mary&nbsp;</em>(Royal Court, 2005);&nbsp;<em>trade</em>&nbsp;(RSC, 2005);&nbsp;<em>born bad&nbsp;</em>(Hampstead Theatre, 2003; Olivier Award for Most Promising Newcomer); and&nbsp;<em>dirty butterfly</em>&nbsp;(Soho Theatre, 2003).</p><p><br></p><p>She wrote and directed the feature film,&nbsp;<em>Second Coming</em>&nbsp;(BFI/Film 4, 2014; International Film Festival Rotterdam Big Screen Award) and adapted her play&nbsp;<em>random</em>&nbsp;into a TV film for Channel 4, which won the 2012 BAFTA for Best Single Drama and the Black International Film/MVSA Award for Best UK Film.</p><p><br></p><p>Her work for radio includes:&nbsp;<em>lament&nbsp;</em>(Radio Academy Arias Gold Award),&nbsp;<em>gone</em>,&nbsp;<em>random</em>,&nbsp;<em>handprint</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>freefall</em><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><p>She was awarded the 2015 Windham Campbell Prize for Drama.</p><p></p></p><h2>Pilgrim</h2><p>The actor captures his journey through India, Nepal, Zanskar, and Tibet through a collection of sixty-five photographs, complete with a foreword by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</p><p>Gere is the most conspicuous of the so-called celebrity Buddhists, a position he has used to make known the suffering of Tibet under Chinese oppression and the tragedy of Tibetan exiles, including his friend and teacher, the Dalai Lama, but it will come as a surprise to many that Gere spends an equal, if not greater, amount of time behind the camera as he does in front.

Gere's painterly photographs capture the motion that occurs even in stillness, and they possess surprising depth; the longer you gaze at them, the more you see. Some are detailed; others explore the stark contrast between shadow and light, and all subtly evoke the contrast between the cruelty of the Chinese army and the compassion of Tibetan Buddhists. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Rogers&#39; Handbook of Pediatric Intensive Care (Nichols, Rogers Handbook of Pediatric Intensive Care)</h2><p>This handbook is a synopsis of the clinical chapters from <b>Rogers' Textbook of Pediatric Intensive Care, Fourth Edition</b> .

The text does not cover some higher level topics-for example, photochemistry, molecular beams, thermal physics, and polymers- found in some textbooks, and rarely covered in the undergraduate physical chemistry course, but more fully explains the essential elements of the discipline. Written by a dedicated chemical educator and researcher, this text is intended for those students who are trying to learn physical chemistry-a book that works as a textbook and not as an encyclopedia. Where appropriate, there is some focus on mathematical manipulations, providing students with a review of calculus applications as applied to physical chemistry.</p><p>David W. Ball is Professor of Chemistry at Cleveland State University. His research interests include computational chemistry of new high energy materials, matrix isolation spectroscopy, and various topics in chemical education. He has over 160 publications, equally split between research articles and educational articles, including five books currently in print. He has won recognition for the quality of his teaching, receiving several departmental and college teaching awards as well as the university&#39;s Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award in 2002. He has been a contributing editor to &#34;Spectroscopy&#34; magazine since 1994, where he writes &#34;The Baseline&#34; column on fundamental topics in spectroscopy. He is also active in professional service, serving on the Board of Trustees for the Northeastern Ohio Science and Engineering Fair and the Board of Governors of the Cleveland Technical Societies Council. He is also very active in the American Chemical Society, serving the Cleveland Section as chair twice (in 1998 and 2009) and Councilor from 2001 to the present."I think the quality of problems and examples is good, and their number is sufficient. Examples in the manuscript are good, and explained thoroughly, without omitting intermediate steps. This is a big plus for Dr. Ball's text. Again, I think that the writing style is very good, language is simple and clear. I will add here that the author's idea to provide some biographical information and portraits of major physical chemists is excellent."<br><br>"The problems and examples seem to be numerous and cover an appropriate range of activities. I do like the breadth of theoretical and numerical examples and problems offered, and I like the continual attention to units--to the point of actually providing examples and problems that address nothing else. Units are an important issue in scientific calculations, one that is often overlooked or under-appreciated by chemistry texts." "Ball's writing style is well-suited for his target audience. His straight-forward, plain English style is easily followed and, I think, would tend to speak TO students rather than OVER them. Students should find his somewhat informal language and candid description to be more palatable than are the traditional formal prose used in many physical chemistry texts. With a textbook that spoke more understandably to begin with, I could imagine spending more time on discussions of concepts rather than discourses on formulation. I think this would be a positive contribution to a learning environment."<br><br>"The biggest strength of the manuscript is that it carefully and clearly explains the logic used in the derivations and the examples. The level of explanation, exercises, etc. is consistent. I really liked the way that Dr. Ball had students think about units first and then worry about the numbers. That is a weak point for many students and having the text clearly use this approach is a real plus. The author set out to generate a user-friendly physical chemistry text and he has succeeded in doing it. This manuscript has a straight-ahead no nonsense feel about it. It is very much ordered as this is what you need to know, this is what it means, and this is how you use it."<br><br>"I certainly agree with the author's attempts to make the textbook less intimidating and encyclopedic. Many physical chemistry textbooks, with the necessary extensive use of mathematical symbolism, are often quite imposing to the average student. Using as many approaches as practicable to make the presentations more reader friendly is a noble, worthwhile goal. The author's uses of introductory chapter synopses, many clearly worked examples, clear derivations, and end-of-chapter summaries are very helpful." "The author includes many carefully worked example problems. These are very helpful in building confidence and reinforcing the student's understanding of concepts. He shows the method for solving these in considerable detail with explanations and often follows up with some discussion of the significance of the result. The author's writing style is very straightforward, clear, and to the point. It would be quite readable by my students. The vocabulary level is generally appropriate for sophomore/junior college students."<br><br>"I was very pleased with the number of examples included in the body of the chapter; in some cases it seemed like a factor of two more than in other texts. I think this is vital to a student's understanding of the material. I was also pleased to see the problems at the end of the chapter grouped by sections. Students must have a series of problems, starting easy and working up in difficulty, in order to work the most challenging problems. I was overall pleased with the balance between simpler and more difficult problems as well as the balance between quantitative and qualitative questions. The latter are too often neglected in physical chemistry texts. I was also pleased to see many problems relating to real world situations. Thermodynamics is much more interesting when applied to problems other than adiabatic expansions of ideal gases! I found the writing style to be conversational and very easy to follow." "The strengths of this manuscript are the detail, mathematical level, and development of the text, the number and quality of example problems, and the selection and range of difficulty in the end of chapter problems."</p><h2>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</h2><p>Robert Browning&#x2019;s famous verse retelling of the medieval legend of the Pied Piper is renowned for its humor and vivid wordplay.

The strongest influence on his education were the books in his father's extensive library, particularly the writings of Byron and Shelley. His dramatic poem <i>Paracelsus</i>, published in 1835, established his reputation and brought him the friendship of the actor-manager William Macready. When Macready's eldest son Willie was ill in bed, Browning wrote for the boy's entertainment the poem of <b>The Pied Piper</b>, a story he remembered from his own childhood. After its appearance in print in 1842, it became a children's classic, attracting new illustrators in every generation.<br><br>In 1846 Robert Browning married a fellow poet, Elizabeth Barrett, eloping with her to Italy where they lived until Elizabeth's death in 1861.

Each law formulates a home truth about business life, such as, &#34;One-tenth of the participants produce over one-third of the output. Increasing the number of participants merely reduces the average output&#34;. Another example of one of &#34;Augustine&#39;s Laws&#34; is Law Number XI, &#34;If the Earth could be made to rotate twice as fast, managers would get twice as much done. If the Earth could be made to rotate 20 times as fast, everyone else would get twice as much done since all the managers would fly off&#34;.</p><p>Drawing on his experience as an aeronautical engineer in industry and for the Pentagon, Augustine, vice-president of Martin Marietta Corp., formulates 52 "laws" designed to avoid or correct bad management practices. In this expanded version of a book originally published by a technical press, his rueful comments and facetiously didactic style, interspersed with numerous examples, quotes, aphorisms and adages, overlay much common sense and shrewd judgment. He is appalled at the inexorable rise in production costs and schedule delays, many of them caused by faulty government cost evaluation and contract-letting systems, and distressed by top-heavy administrations and over-reliance on technology. Among his targets are MBA programs, a surfeit of lawyers and experts of all kinds, along with lengthy maintenance manuals, and unnecessary committees and meetings. Rules and regulations, he concludes, cannot replace management competence. Photos. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Augustine, executive vice-president of Martin Marietta, has put together a book made up of three parts that seem to bear no relation to each other, yet are forced into an unlikely union: a sort of running commentary on the fortunes of the Daedalus Model Airplane Company; 52 "laws" formulated by Augustine and intended to explain everything from advertising to saving money; and an enormous array of observations, quotations, charts, anecdotes, and bits of information on a baffling number of topics. While this book is obviously the fruit of immense industry, it is scrappy and diffusethe material for a good book rather than a finished work. A. J.

Set in the early 19th century, this novel is a subtle representation of historical change explored in human terms.</p><p>Set in English society before the 1832 Reform Bill, Wives and Daughters centres on the story of youthful Molly Gibson, brought up from childhood by her father. When he remarries, a new step-sister enters Molly&#39;s quiet life - loveable, but worldly and troubling, Cynthia. The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford. Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society. &#39;No nineteenth-century novel contains a more devastating rejection than this of the Victorian male assumption of moral authority&#39;, writes Pam Morris in her introduction to this new edition, in which she explores the novel&#39;s main themes - the role of women, Darwinism and the concept of Englishness - and its literary and social context.<b>Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell</b>&nbsp;was born in London in 1810, but she spent her formative years in Cheshire, Stratford-upon-Avon and the north of England. In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell, who became well known as the minister of the Unitarian Chapel in Manchester&#x2019;s Cross Street. As well as leading a busy domestic life as minister&#x2019;s wife and mother of four daughters, she worked among the poor, traveled frequently and wrote.&nbsp;<i>Mary Barton</i>&nbsp;(1848) was her first success.Two years later she began writing for Dickens&#x2019;s magazine,&nbsp;<i>Household Words</i>, to which she contributed fiction for the next thirteen years, notably a further industrial novel,&nbsp;<i>North and South&nbsp;</i>(1855). <br><br>In 1850 she met and secured the friendship of Charlotte Bront�. After Charlotte&#x2019;s death in March 1855, Patrick Bront� chose his daughter&#x2019;s friend and fellow-novelist to write <i>The&nbsp;Life of Charlotte Bront�&nbsp;</i>(1857), a probing and sympathetic account, that has attained classic stature. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s position as a clergyman&#x2019;s wife and as a successful writer introduced her to a wide circle of friends, both from the professional world of Manchester and from the larger literary world. Her output was substantial and completely professional. Dickens discovered her resilient strength of character when trying to impose his views on her as editor of&nbsp;<i>Household Words</i>. She proved that she was not to be bullied, even by such a strong-willed man.<br><br>Her later works,<i>&nbsp;Sylvia&#x2019;s Lovers&nbsp;</i>(1863),&nbsp;<i>Cousin Phillis&nbsp;</i>(1864) and&nbsp;<i>Wives and Daughters</i>&nbsp;(1866) reveal that she was continuing to develop her writing in new literary directions.

The authors find that smokers tend to be overly optimistic about their longevity and future health if they quit later in life. </p><p>Older adults' decisions to quit smoking require personal experience with the serious health impacts associated with smoking. Smokers over fifty revise their risk perceptions only after experiencing a major health shock--such as a heart attack. But less serious symptoms, such as shortness of breath, do not cause changes in perceptions. Waiting for such a jolt to occur is imprudent. </p><p>The authors show that well-crafted messages about how smoking affects quality of life can greatly affect current perceptions of smoking risks. If smokers are informed of long-term consequences of a disease, and if they are told that quitting can indeed come too late, they are able to evaluate the risks of smoking more accurately, and act accordingly.</p></p><p><p>Frank A.

This warning label does not appear in the scholarly book by Sloan and his coauthors, but if the avenue of research they propose is carried out, something like it may be used in the not-too-distant future. In this book, the authors have taken on the tasks of developing and (much more difficult) quantifying effective strategies to persuade late-middle-aged smokers to quit smoking. Many information campaigns about the dangers of smoking are directed specifically at younger people (for excellent reasons), and one might think that older smokers are hopelessly entrenched and simply immune to basic health messages. The writers have obvious sympathy for the millions of smokers who became addicted before the advent of warning labels on cigarettes -- a product that can be excruciatingly difficult to give up. The authors' stated goal in this book is to "break down the smoking puzzle into its constituent elements -- information, risk perception, and smoking behavior." And they achieve this with a modest but authoritative presentation of their own work, combined with examinations of other research on the subject. The discussions and conclusions presented are readily accessible to the lay professional, but the detailed analysis of methods and results might best be appreciated by epidemiologists, economists, and others familiar with statistical analysis. The results of focus-group studies carried out by the authors, like many great discoveries, are almost obvious. The most effective deterrents to smoking for people who have been addicted for decades are highly personalized: for instance, the advent of a major smoking-related illness to the smoker or a close family member. Since many smokers may reason (not illogically) "We all have to go some-time . . .," health messages that stress the possible loss of a few years of life are simply not as effective as bringing home the realization that the end of life may not come quickly and painlessly but might well entail considerable helplessness and disability, a dread to which we can all relate. I was delighted with the authors' suggestions for further research, which included the idea that information campaigns that emphasize quitting might also give advice on how to avoid gaining weight in the process. That message is scholarly common sense at its best. The authors suggest, and I agree, that with so many lives at stake, much more must be done to translate disease risks to personal action and tailor messages to fit the needs of any given population subgroup. <i>Luis G.

This collection of hymns and petitions was written over a span of centuries, in many different settings, by kings such as David and Solomon and commoners like Asaph, Heman, and the sons of Korah. Some of the psalms are defiant; others are reverent. Some are meant to be sung; others are to be prayed. Some are intensely personal; others are written as if the whole world is to use them. But all have one purpose &#x2013; to help us express our hears to God. So don&#x2019;t just read these psalms but actually pray them along with the saints who composed them.

This hard left movement's predominantly male and working-class members looked back with fondness on Robespierre and the Reign of Terror; they embraced violence as a necessary means for bringing about revolutionary change and favored a top-down approach to governing. The movement was optimistic in July 1830, as Paris was rocked by revolution. The new king, Louis-Philippe, at first talked like a republican, but soon began governing by repression: he curbed freedom of the press and association, and immediately began cracking down on republican dissent. The montagnard organizations, whose structure and philosophy are skillfully detailed by Colgate historian Harsin, were forced deep underground. They hoarded weapons and stayed one step ahead of the police, awaiting the call to arms. There were several failed republican insurgencies during Louis-Philippe's July Monarchy (1830 1848), each followed by trials, repressive new laws and police crackdowns. Harsin uses newspaper accounts, court transcripts and memoirs to bring readers inside the minds of these desperate republicans and their doomed rebellions. Finally, in 1848, one of the most tumultuous years in French history, Louis-Philippe abdicated; a provisional government was established with republican leanings. Alas, the montagnard movement considered the new government too bourgeois, and another bloody insurgency broke out in July 1848. Once again, the montagnards were defeated; exile, prison and death were the fates of many of their leaders. Despite the drama, Harsin's narrative is recommended mainly for those with a serious interest in 19th-century French republicanism, especially its hard left aspects. 14 b&amp;w illus.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Teen Health: Course 1</h2><p>very good condition, little marks on cover.

It always has been an extremely valuable tool to the organic chemist by supplying molecular &#34;finger print&#34; spectra at the atomic level. Unfortunately the high resolution achievable in liquid solutions could not be obtained in solids and physicists and physical chemists had to live with unresolved lines open to a wealth of curve fitting procedures and a vast amount of speculations. High resolution NMR in solids seemed to be a paradoxon. Broad structure� less lines are usually encountered when dealing with NMR in solids. Only with the recent advent of mUltiple pulse, magic angle, cross-polarization, two-dimen� sional and multiple-quantum spectroscopy and other techniques during the last decade it became possible to resolve finer details of nuclear spin interactions in solids. I have felt that graduate students, researchers and others beginning to get involved with these techniques needed a book which treats the principles, theo� retical foundations and applications of these rather sophisticated experimental techniques. Therefore I wrote a monograph on the subject in 1976. Very soon new ideas led to the developement of &#34;two-dimensional spectroscopy&#34; and &#34;multiple-quantum spectroscopy&#34;, topics which were not covered in the first edition of my book. Moreover an exponential growth of literature appeared in this area of research leaving the beginner in an awkward situation of tracing back from a current article to the roots of the experiment.</p><p></p><h2>The Healing Benefits of Acupressure: Acupuncture Without Needles</h2><p>Shows how the simple application of finger pressure to specific points of the body can stimulate and alleviate many common ailments</p><p></p><h2>Great Astronomers</h2><p>Great Astronomers By Robert S.

The years since 1970 have seen changes in product design and packaging, corporate investments, personal career and lifestyle choices, government tax policies, and emerging technologies to name but a few because public and private decisions are now shaped by environmental and natural resource issues. </p> <p>With this book, I hope to bring those of you starting your study of environmental and natural resource economics close to today&#x2019;s exciting policy issues and introduce you to the theories and methods of analysis that economists use to approach these issues. This book shows you how economic tools, such as benefit-cost analysis, can be used to understand a wide range of real environmental and natural resource problems. The tools of economists can help design practical policy solutions to environmental problems. They also can contribute to public debate about complicated and emotional environmental issues by providing a framework that is universal, rigorous and testable. </p> <p>This book is intended to be readable by students who have completed one semester of microeconomic principles, but it also will engage students with a wider economics background. The aim of the book is to provide an introduction to environmental and natural resource issues and to describe economic theories and methods used by experts working in the field. </p> <p>Graphs, tables, and numerical examples are included to reinforce the principles presented in the text. No mathematics beyond simple algebra is required. All mathematics beyond algebra (e.g., calculus) is relegated to footnotes and appendixes. Most chapters have several numbered examples that present current, real-life examples for research and policy applications of the economic principles discussed in the chapter. Each chapter ends with questions that provide an opportunity to apply the chapter&#x2019;s material through class discussion, personal reflection, and exam preparation. The appendixes at the end of the book include advanced quantitative methods of analysis. </p> <p>The topics and structure of this book encourage its use for a variety of course work. All of the chapters could find a place in an upper division environmental economics course. Some chapters could be a source for graduate student or others who wish to pursue more specialized research interests. There may be more material in this book that can be cover well in one semester. The additional information opens up options for selecting topics that best cover the interests, expectations, and backgrounds of instructors and students. For example, a one-semester course in environmental economics could be organized around Chapters 1 - 7 and 14 - 19. If a brief introduction to natural resource economics is desired, Chapter 8 and/or 12 could be added. A one-term course in natural resource economics could cover Chapters 1- 6 and 8 - 13. An introduction to environmental economics could be accomplished by adding Chapter 7 and/or Chapter 16. </p> <p>This focuses on environmental and natural resource policy. It presents a considerable amount of economic theory, methods, and data for the purpose of gaining a better insight into policy solutions. Although this is an economics book, it is not limited to economics. Economics is not a stand-alone discipline; rather, other disciplines complement the ability of economics to sharpen our understanding pf policy issues. The disciplines of biology, the physical sciences, law, history, political science, and philosophy are introduced where their insights enhance the power of economics in confronting policy problems. In some cases, combining other disciplines with economics presents contrasting views of a problem, focuses a policy debate, or suggests competing hypotheses in the search for policy solutions. </p> <p>Chapters begin with a background incident or example that motivates and introduces the economic theories, methods of analysis, and policy questions that follow. Each chapter has a short section of clearly stated chapter goals. Relevant economic principles are introduced as a resource for posing questions, testing and supplying theories, understanding policy debates, and posing future questions. Footnotes are included to cover advanced or specialized treatment and to encourage students to pursue their own reading or research. Current methods of analysis, data sources, and ongoing studies are presented. Policy debates are analyzed along with unanswered questions posed by those debates. References to the current literature are open and transparent. </p> <p>This book is optimistic. It presumes that past gains in environmental protection and natural resource management will be maintained and that future gains are both desirable and possible. There is little future in pessimism. Students are eager to understand how economics concepts, like markets, can explain and address environmental and natural resource problems. The text is pro-environment and it also emphasizes the role of profit incentives in promoting the cooperation of business in protecting the environment and ensuring adequacy of natural resource supplies. </p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Human Nutrition: Science for Healthy Living</h2><p>Human Nutrition: Science for Healthy Living is an interesting, engaging, reliable, and evidence-based introductory textbook with a wide variety of features to promote active learning.

Drug prohibitions were few, and while alcohol was considered a menace, the public regularly consumed substances that are widely demonized today. Heroin was marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, and marijuana was available as a tincture of cannabis sold by Parke Davis and Company.<p></p><p>Exploring how this rather benign relationship with psychoactive drugs was transformed into one of confusion and chaos, <i>The Cult of Pharmacology</i> tells the dramatic story of how, as one legal drug after another fell from grace, new pharmaceutical substances took their place.

He argues that the determination to treat the medically sanctioned use of drugs such as Miltown or Seconal separately from the illicit use of substances like heroin or ecstasy has blinded America to how drugs are transformed by the manner in which a culture deals with them.</p><p>Bringing forth a wealth of scientific research showing the powerful influence of social and psychological factors on how the brain is affected by drugs, DeGrandpre demonstrates that psychoactive substances are not angels or demons irrespective of why, how, or by whom they are used. <i>The Cult of Pharmacology</i> is a bold and necessary new account of America&#x2019;s complex relationship with drugs.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;The Cult of Pharmacology&#34; brings badly needed information, insight, and--above all--sanity to the emotionally charged debate over legal and illegal drugs in America, whether LSD, caffeine, or Prozac.

C++ is also a language for generic programming, a methodology that can greatly enhance your ability to write efficient and reusable software components.</p><p><p> This is not a book about object-oriented programming. </p><p> You may think that's odd. You probably found this book in the C++ section of the bookstore, after all, and you've probably heard people use object oriented and C++ synonymously, but that isn't the only way to use the C++ language. C++ supports several fundamentally different paradigms, the newest and least familiar of which is generic programming. </p><p> Like most new ideas, generic programming actually has a long history. Some of the early research papers on generic programming are nearly 25 years old, and the first experimental generic libraries were written not in C++ but in Ada MS89a, MS89b and Scheme KMS88. Yet generic programming is new enough that no textbooks on the subject exist. </p><p> The first example of generic programming to become important outside of research groups was the STL, the C++ Standard Template Library. The Standard Template Library, designed by Alexander Stepanov (then of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories) and Meng Lee, was accepted in 1994 as part of the C++ standard library. The freely available "HP implementation" SL95, which served as a demonstration of the STL's capabilities, was released the same year. </p><p> When the Standard Template Library first became part of the C++ standard, the C++ community immediately recognized it as a library of high-quality and efficient container classes. It is always easiest to see what is familiar, and every C++ programmer is familiar with container classes. Every nontrivial program requires some way of managing a collection of objects, and every C++ programmer has written a class that implements strings or vectors or lists.</p><p></p><p> Container class libraries have been available since the earliest days of C++, and when "template" classes (parameterized types) were added to the language, one of their first uses--indeed, one of the main reasons that templates were introduced--was parameterized container classes. Many different vendors, including Borland, Microsoft, Rogue Wave, and IBM, wrote their own libraries that included Array or its equivalent. </p><p> The fact that container classes are so familiar made the STL seem at first to be nothing more than yet another container class library. This familiarity diverted attention from the ways in which the STL was unique. </p><p> The STL is a large and extensible body of efficient, generic, and interoperable software components. It includes many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science, and it is written so that algorithms and data structures are decoupled from each other. Rather than a container class library, it is more accurate to think of the STL as a library of generic algorithms; containers exist so that the algorithms have something to operate on. </p><p> You can use the existing STL algorithms in your programs, just as you can use the existing STL containers. For example, you can use the generic STL sort as you would use the function qsort from the standard C library (although sort is simpler, more flexible, safer, and more efficient). Several books, including David Musser and Atul Saini's STL Tutorial and Reference Guide MS96 and Mark Nelson's C++ Programmer's Guide to the Standard Template Library Nel95, explain how to use the STL in such a way. </p><p> Even this much is useful. It is always better to reuse code than to rewrite it, and you can reuse the existing STL algorithms in your own programs. This is still, however, only one aspect of the STL. The STL was designed to be extensible; that is, it was designed so that, just as the different STL components are interoperable with each other, they are also interoperable with components you write yourself. Using the STL effectively means extending it. Generic Programming </p><p> The STL is not just a collection of useful components. Its other aspect, which is less widely recognized and understood, is that it is a formal hierarchy of abstract requirements that describe software components. The reason that the STL's components are interoperable and extensible, and the reason that you can add new algorithms and new containers and can be confident that the new pieces and the old can be used together, is that all STL components are written to conform to precisely specified requirements. </p><p> Most of the important advances in computer science have been the discoveries of new kinds of abstractions. One crucial abstraction supported by all contemporary computer languages is the subroutine (a.k.a. the procedure or function--different languages use different terminology). Another abstraction supported by C++ is that of abstract data typing. In C++, it is possible to define a new data type together with that type's basic operations. </p><p> The combination of code and data forms an abstract data type, one that is always manipulated through a well-defined interface. Subroutines are an important abstraction because using a subroutine doesn't require that you depend on (or even necessarily know) its exact implementation; similarly, you can use an abstract data type--you can manipulate and even create values--without depending on the actual representation of the data. Only the interface is important. </p><p> C++ also supports object-oriented programming Boo94, Mey97, which involves hierarchies of polymorphic data types related by inheritance. Object-oriented programming has one more layer of indirection than abstract data typing, thus it achieves one more step in abstraction. In some circumstances you can refer to a value and manipulate it without needing to specify its exact type. You can write a single function that will operate on a number of types within an inheritance hierarchy. </p><p> Generic programming, too, means identifying a new kind of abstraction. The central abstraction of generic programming is less tangible than earlier abstractions like the subroutine or the class or the module. It is a set of requirements on data types. This is a difficult abstraction to grasp because it isn't tied to a specific C++ language feature. There is no keyword in C++ (or, for that matter, in any contemporary computer language) for declaring a set of abstract requirements. </p><p> What generic programming provides in return for understanding an abstraction that at first seems frustratingly nebulous is an unprecedented level of flexibility. Just as important, it achieves abstraction without loss of efficiency. Generic programming, unlike object-oriented programming, does not require you to call functions through extra levels of indirection; it allows you to write a fully general and reusable algorithm that is just as efficient as an algorithm handcrafted for a specific data type. </p><p> A generic algorithm is written by abstracting algorithms on specific types and specific data structures so that they apply to arguments whose types are as general as possible. This means that a generic algorithm actually has two parts: the actual instructions that describe the steps of the algorithm and the set of requirements that specify precisely which properties its argument types must satisfy. </p><p> The central innovation of the STL is the recognition that these type requirements can be specified and systematized. That is, it is possible to define a set of abstract concepts and to say that a type conforms to one of those concepts if it satisfies a certain set of requirements. These concepts are important because most of the assumptions that algorithms make about their types can be expressed both in terms of conformance to concepts and in terms of the relationships between different concepts. Additionally, these concepts form a well-defined hierarchy, one reminiscent of inheritance in traditional object-oriented programming but purely abstract. </p><p> This hierarchy of concepts is the conceptual structure of the STL. It is the most important part of the STL, and it is what makes reuse and interoperability possible. The conceptual structure would be important purely as a formal taxonomy of software components, even without its embodiment in code. The STL does include concrete data structures, such as pair and list, but to use those data structure effectively you must understand the conceptual structure they are built upon. </p><p> Defining abstract concepts and writing algorithms and data structures in terms of abstract concepts is the essence of generic programming. How to Read This Book </p><p> This book describes the Standard Template Library as a library of abstract concepts. It defines the fundamental concepts and abstractions of the STL and shows what it means for a type to model one of those concepts or for an algorithm to be written in terms of a concept's interface. It discusses the classes and algorithms that are part of the basic STL, and it explains how you can write your own STL-compliant classes and algorithms and when you might want to do so. Finally, it includes a complete reference manual of all of the STL's concepts, classes, and algorithms. </p><p> Everyone should read Part I, which introduces the main ideas of the STL and of generic programming. It shows how to use and write a generic algorithm, and it explains what it means for an algorithm to be generic. Genericity has implications that go far beyond the ability to operate on multiple data types. </p><p> Exploring the idea of a generic algorithm leads naturally to the central ideas of concepts, modeling, and refinement, ideas that are as basic to generic programming as polymorphism and inheritance are to object-oriented programming. Generic algorithms on one-dimensional ranges, meanwhile, lead to the fundamental concepts of the STL: iterators, containers, and function objects. </p><p> Part I introduces the notation and the typographical conventions that are used throughout the remainder of the book: the terminology of modeling and refinement, the asymmetrical notation for ranges, and the special typeface for concept names. </p><p> The STL defines many concepts, some of which differ from each other only in technical details. Part I is an overview, and it discusses the broad outlines of STL concepts. Part II is a detailed reference manual that contains a precise definition of each STL concept. You may not wish to read Part II all the way through and, instead, may find it more useful to look up a particular concept only when you need to refer to its definition. (You should refer to Part II whenever you write a new type that conforms to an STL concept.) </p><p> Part III is also a reference manual. It documents the STL's predefined algorithms and classes. It relies heavily on the concept definitions of Part II. All STL algorithms and almost all concrete types are templates, and every template parameter can be characterized as the model of some concept. The definitions in Part III are cross-referenced to the appropriate sections of Part II. </p><p> In an ideal world, the book would end with Part III. Unfortunately, reality demands one more section, an appendix that discusses portability concerns. When the STL was first released, portability was not an issue because only one implementation existed. That is no longer the case, and whenever more than one implementation of any language or library exists, anyone who cares about portability must be aware of the differences between them. </p><p> The old HP implementation is still available by anonymous FTP from butler.hpl.hp, but it is no longer being maintained. A newer free implementation, from Silicon Graphics Computer Systems (SGI) is available at sgi/Technology/STL, and a port of the SGI STL to a variety of compilers, maintained by Boris Fomitchev, is available at metabyte/~fbp/stl. Finally, there are several different commercial STL implementations. </p><p> If you are writing real programs, it isn't enough to understand the theoretical design of the library; you also have to understand how the various STL implementations and the various C++ compilers differ. These unglamorous but necessary details are the subject of Appendix A.</p><p>Who Should Read This Book </p><p> While this book is largely about algorithms written in C++, it is neither an introductory textbook on algorithms nor a C++ tutorial. It does explain some of the unfamiliar aspects of both subjects. In particular, since the STL uses templates in ways that are uncommon in other sorts of C++ programs, it discusses some advanced techniques of programming with templates. This should not be your first C++ book, nor should it be your first exposure to an analysis of algorithms. You should know how to write basic C++ programs, and you should know the meaning of notation like O(N). </p><p> Two of the standard references on algorithms and data structures are Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming Knu97, Knu98a, Knu98b, and Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest CLR90. Two of the best introductory C++ books are The C++ Programming Language, by Bjarne Stroustrup Str97 and A C++ Primer, by Stanley Lippman and Jos�e Lajoie LL98. How This Book Came About </p><p> I joined the compiler group at Silicon Graphics Computer Systems (SGI) in 1996. Alex Stepanov had left HP to join SGI several months before. At the time, SGI's C++ compiler did not include an implementation of the Standard Template Library. Using the original HP implementation as our source base, Alex, Hans Boehm, and I wrote the version of the STL that was shipped with release 7.1 (and subsequent releases) of SGI's MIPSpro compiler. </p><p> The SGI Standard Template Library Aus97 included many new and extended features, such as efficient and thread-safe memory allocation, hash tables, and algorithmic improvements. If these enhancements had remained proprietary, they would have been of no value to SGI's customers, so the SGI STL was made freely available to the public. It is distributed on the World Wide Web, along with its documentation, at sgi/Technology/STL. </p><p> The documentation, a set of Web pages, treats the STL's conceptual structure as central. It describes the abstract concepts that comprise the structure, and it documents the STL's algorithms and data structures in terms of the abstract concepts. We received many requests for an expanded form of the documentation, and this book is a response to those requests. The reference sections of this book, Parts II and III, are an outgrowth of the SGI STL Web pages. </p><p> The Web pages were written for and are copyrighted by SGI. I am using them with the kind permission of my management. Acknowledgments </p><p> First and foremost, this book could not possibly have existed without the work of Alex Stepanov. Alex was involved with this book at every stage: he brought me to SGI, he taught me almost everything I know about generic programming, he participated in the development of the SGI STL and the SGI STL Web pages, and he encouraged me to turn the Web pages into a book. I am grateful to Alex for all of his help and encouragement. </p><p> I also wish to thank Bjarne Stroustrup and Andy Koenig for helping me to understand C++ and Dave Musser for his numerous contributions (some of which can be found in the bibliography) to generic programming, to the STL, and to this book. Dave used an early version of the SGI STL Web pages as part of his course material, and the Web pages were greatly improved through his and his students' comments. </p><p> Similarly, this book was greatly improved thr...</p><p> Many programmers are unaware that C++ is more than an object-oriented language.

Against the backdrop of corporate, political, and religious scandal, a contemporary examination of the complex and subtle relationships between ethics and leadership could not be more timely. In this updated and expanded edition, Joanne Ciulla presents a unique collection of essays by philosophers, leadership scholars with backgrounds in industrial and organizational psychology, and management theorists. The authors tackle such profound questions as: How do leaders motivate followers to achieve their goals? What is the moral relationship between leaders and followers? Are ethical leaders driven by self-interest or altruism? What is the ethical value of a leader's accomplishments? Do their actions serve the greatest good? Featuring new essays by Bruce Avolio and Edwin Locke, Terry Price, Bernie Bass and Paul Steidlmeier, and a foreword by James MacGregor Burns, this book probes what the answers to these questions mean for today's leaders, offering hands-on insights into the ethical dynamics that make the heart of leadership tick.</p></p><p><p>The classic text on the role of ethics in leadership-updated and expanded for the next generation of leaders.</p><p>JOANNE B.

A. Cohen sets out to rescue the egalitarian thesis that in a society in which distributive justice prevails, people&#x2019;s material prospects are roughly equal. Arguing against the Rawlsian version of a just society, Cohen demonstrates that distributive justice does not tolerate deep inequality. </p><p>In the course of providing a deep and sophisticated critique of Rawls&#x2019;s theory of justice, Cohen demonstrates that questions of distributive justice arise not only for the state but also for people in their daily lives. The right rules for the macro scale of public institutions and policies also apply, with suitable adjustments, to the micro level of individual decision-making. </p><p>Cohen also charges Rawls&#x2019;s constructivism with systematically conflating the concept of justice with other concepts. Within the Rawlsian architectonic, justice is not distinguished either from other values or from optimal rules of social regulation. The elimination of those conflations brings justice closer to equality.</p></p><p>G. A. Cohen was Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford University.&#x201c;With his characteristic brilliance and philosophical depth, G.A. Cohen aims to defend a more pure equality and justice by retrieving them from Rawlsian liberalism. The result is a bracing challenge to contemporary complacency about inequality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joshua Cohen, Stanford University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This book is easily the deepest and most sophisticated critical work on Rawls's theory of justice. It brings together several distinct lines of argument that Cohen has been developing over the past two decades. In so doing, it manages to provide both a detailed and intricate critique of Rawls's approach to economic distribution and, at the same time, to articulate and defend a different way of thinking about the fundamental questions of economic distribution.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arthur Ripstein, University of Toronto</b><br><br>&#x201c;Many liberals favor a relatively permissive attitude to economic inequality, and do so partly because they assume the egalitarian values governing our political decisions are inapplicable to our more everyday decisions.

It seems to be the job she was born for. And yet for much of her early life the young princess did not know the role that her future would hold. She was our accidental Queen. <p>Elizabeth's determination to share in the struggles of her people marked her out from a young age. Her father initially refused to let her volunteer as a nurse during the Blitz, but relented when she was 18 and allowed her to work as a mechanic and truck driver for the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was her forward-thinking approach that ensured that her coronation was televised, against the advice of politicians at the time.</p><p>Kate Williams reveals how the 25-year-old young queen carved out a lasting role for herself amid the changes of the 20th century. Her monarchy would be a very different one to that of her parents and grandparents, and its continuing popularity in the 21st century owes much to the intelligence and elusive personality of this remarkable woman.</p> 16 pages of color and B&amp;W illustrations</p><p>Kate Williams&nbsp;is a professor of history at the University of Reading and the author of England&#x2019;s Mistress, Becoming Queen Victoria, and The Betrayal of Mary, Queen of Scots.&#x201c;This lively, gossipy narrative offers a sympathetic portrait of a young woman whose path to the throne resulted from two unexpected events: the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII, which made her father King George VI; and her father's early death, which elevated 25-year-old Elizabeth to queen of England.

Rather than a contest or a collapse, war is analysed as a system that has significant functions and that yields complex economic, political and psychological benefits. Some may be more interested in prolonging a war than in ending it. War may help elites to derail democracy and suppress dissent; it may be profitable for government and rebel actors; and it may allow armed groups to enjoy a sense of power over unarmed civilians.</p> <p>This book argues that understanding the complex functions of wars alongside other forms of human disaster, such as famine and ethnic strife, is essential if we are to reduce suffering and move towards lasting peace agreements.</p> <p><i>Complex Emergencies</i> will be essential reading for students of development, political economy, political science and international relations.</p></p><p>This timely new book by David Keen analyses the abusive systems that surround and produce humanitarian disasters. It gives particular attention to the economic, political and psychological functions of civil conflicts and humanitarian disasters. This analysis is used as a foundation for discussing interventions that have proven to be helpful or unhelpful in the international world. As a leading figure in the field, the structure of the book reflects the evolution of Keen&#39;s thinking in these areas and the way his focus has changed over time. The book begins with famine and moves to consider war and then trade, before looking at some more psychological factors in mass violence, at the role of information in disasters, at humanitarian aid finally, at possibilities for peace. The book will suggest that interventions need to take account of both the vested interests in a conflict and the emotional factors which also inform violence. This very succinct and accessible book will appeal to students of development studies, war and peace studies, international relations, politics and government, human rights, sociology, anthropology and social psychology. It will also interest aid workers and government officials working in this area.<b>David Keen </b>is Reader in Complex Emergencies at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p><h2>Social Problems [RENTAL EDITION]</h2><p>Textbook only</p><p></p><h2>Lord Salisbury&#39;s World: Conservative Environments in Late-Victorian Britain</h2><p>Lord Salisbury (1830-1903) is now a subject of intense historical attention. But while other scholars have chosen to present biographies of him, this important and accessible new study moves away from the conventional &#34;life&#34; and reconstructs the thought-world of late-Victorian Conservatives for the first time. In doing so it provides a new location within which Victorian politics and Salisbury himself can be evaluated.

Bentley quite rightly remarks that Lord Salisbury was `bitingly intelligent, focused and funny' (p. 6).

Descriptions of the factors shaping the outcomes of preliminary hearings, courtroom dispositions, and sentences rely on multivariate analysis of case and defendant variables drawn from court and prosecutor files. It uses the organizational approach to analyze and interpret the results, providing a model widely used and cited for broader studies. <b>Originally published in 1977 by Little, Brown and Company.</b></p><p></p><h2>The Party at Jack&#39;s: A Novella</h2><p>In the summer of 1937, Thomas Wolfe was in the North Carolina mountains revising a piece about a party and subsequent fire at the Park Avenue penthouse apartment of the fictional Esther and Frederick Jack. He wrote to his agent, Elizabeth Nowell, 'I think it is now a single thing, as much a single thing as anything I've ever written.' Abridged and edited versions of the story were published twice, as a novella in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> (May 1939) and as part of <i>You Can't Go Home Again</i> (1940). Now Suzanne Stutman and John Idol have worked from manuscript sources at Harvard University to reconstruct <i>The Party at Jack's</i> as outlined by Wolfe before his death. Here, in its untruncated state, Wolfe's novella affords a significant glimpse of a Depression-era New York inhabited by Wall Street wheelers and dealers and the theatrical and artistic elite. Wolfe describes the Jacks and their social circle with lavish attention to mannerisms and to clothing, furnishings, and other trappings of wealth and privilege. The sharply drawn contrast between the decadence of the party-goers and the struggles of the working classes in the streets below reveals Wolfe's gifts as both a writer and a sharp social critic.<br><br></p><p>"I think it is now a single thing, as much a single thing as anything I've ever written."--Thomas Wolfe, to his agent, Elizabeth Nowell <br>Thomas Clayton Wolfe (October 3, 1900 &#x2013; September 15, 1938) was a major American novelist of the early 20th century.</p><h2>Short Guide to Writing About Biology, A (Valuepack Item Only)</h2><p><p>This best-selling writing guide teaches students to think as biologists and to express ideas clearly and concisely through their writing.</p></p><p></p><h2>Digital @ Scale: The Playbook You Need to Transform Your Company</h2><p><b>A blueprint for reinventing the core of your business</b> <p>Value in the next phase of the digital era will go to those companies that don't just try digital but also <i>scale</i> it. <i>Digital@Scale</i> examines what it takes for companies to break through the gravitational pull of their legacy organizations and capture the full value of digital.

The environment-centered story is about humans distancing themselves from the rest of nature and searching for a relationship that strikes a balance between constructive and destructive exploitation. The culture-centered story is of how human cultures have become mutually influential and yet mutually differentiating. Both stories have been going on for thousands of years. We do not know whether they will end in triumph or disaster. There is no prospect of covering all of world history in one book. Rather, the fabric of this book is woven from selected strands. Readers will see these at every turn, twisted together into yarn, stretched into stories. Human-focused historical ecology-the environmental theme-will drive readers back, again and again, to the same concepts: sustenance, shelter, disease, energy, technology, art. (The last is a vital category for historians, not only because it is part of our interface with the rest of the world, but also because it forms a record of how we see reality and of how the way we see it changes.) In the global story of human interactions-the cultural theme-we return constantly to the ways people make contact with each another: migration, trade, war, imperialism, pilgrimage, gift exchange, diplomacy, travel-and to their social frameworks: the economic and political arenas, the human groups and groupings, the states and civilizations, the sexes and generations, the classes and clusters of identity.Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto holds the William P.

With well over 200 million copies sold, it ranks amongst the most famous works in the history of literary fiction. The novel depicts the plight of the French peasantry demoralised by the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the revolution, the corresponding brutality demonstrated by the revolutionaries toward the former aristocrats in the early years of the revolution, and many unflattering social parallels with life in London during the same time period. It follows the lives of several characters through these events. The 45-chapter novel was published in 31 weekly instalments in Dickens&#39;s new literary periodical titled All the Year Round. From April 1859 to November 1859, Dickens also republished the chapters as eight monthly sections in green covers. All but three of Dickens&#39;s previous novels had appeared only as monthly instalments. The first weekly instalment of A Tale of Two Cities ran in the first issue of All the Year Round on 30 April 1859. The last ran thirty weeks later, on 26 November.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>."It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness...." <br>The most famous and possibly the most popular of Dickens's novels, "A Tale of Two Cities shows a master of dramatic narrative extracting gold from the ore of history. If the bloody tableau of the French Revolution were not in itself sufficient for a dozen novels, Dickens added to it a professional resurrectionist, an authentic ogress, and an antihero as convincingly flawed as any in modern literature. Here, too, are all of Dickens's recurring themes -- imprisonment, injustice, and cataclysmic violence, resurrection and the renunciation that makes renewal possible.</p><h2>David Busch&#39;s Nikon D7000 Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch&#39;s Digital Photography Guides)</h2><p>The D7000 is the most advanced mid-level camera Nikon has ever introduced, boasting 16.2 megapixels of resolution, full HDTV video, stunning image quality, the real-time preview system Live View, and blazing-fast 39-point automatic focus.

Wherever possible, practical recommendations are based on empirical research, and where there is no research to draw upon, the tentative nature of the recommendation or conclusion is indicated.

For readers who need only an overview of a topic, the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter should suffice. Most readers will hopefully be enticed to read further; the essential information on each topic is marked with a shaded bar in the margin. These marked paragraphs are designed to be read, and to be understandable, without the intervening paragraphs. I think of the marked material as a thin book buried inside this thick book. Some academic courses may wish to restrict themselves to just this material, which includes approximately half the book. The remaining material provides a greater level of detail. Finally, the most detailed comments are tucked away as footnotes and as sections in small print. The material at all levels is further segmented by presenting the most theoretical material and the most practical material in the form of self-contained panels. These two types of panels are differentiated by their appearance and by the panel titles.</p><p>Praise for this book:</p><p><i>This book succeeds in its aim of providing a practically useful and theoretically sound comprehensive book on hearing aids ...

Hope details how the social and political upheaval of the period challenged the structure and ethos of the Reformation churches, and how Protestantism evolved to meet these profound challenges.<br></p><p>This book is the first history in English of the Lutheran Church in Germany and Scandinavia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A period of fundamental and lasting change in the political landscape - with the separation of the old twin monarchies of Sweden-Finland and Denmark-Norway in Scandinavia (1809, 1814), and the unification of Germany (1866-71) - this was also a time of particular unease and upheaval for the Church. Attempts to emulate the spiritual community of the early Church, reform of the Church establishment, and steps taken to enlighten parishioners were almost always held back by the anomalous structural legacy of the Reformation, tradition, and parish habit, sacred and profane. However, the birth of the modern nation-state and its market economy posed a fundamental challenge to the structure and ethos of the Reformation churches, as it did to the Catholic church. The First World War deepened the crisis further: German Protestants (and the Scandinavians were not immune either, although they remained neutral), who bracketed modernity with crisis and religion with national renewal, and who saw national loyalty as a higher value than the faith, fellowship, and moral order of the Church, were swept up into the maw of a modern national war machine which threatened to wipe out Protestantism altogether.Nicholas Hope is at University of Glasgow, and visiting Fellow at University of Heidelberg.</p><h2>Social Fabric, Volume I, The (10th Edition)</h2><p><p><b>This anthology of readings portrays the lives of ordinary Americans and examines the diversity of the American people, from the earliest settlement of </b><b>America</b><b> to Reconstruction.</b></p></p><p></p><h2>The Social Life of Opium in China</h2><p>The history of Opium in China begins in the mid-Ming dynasty, when as a tribute from vassal states, it was initially used as an aphrodisiac in the Ming court.

Is trafficking the perfection or the perversion of free trade? Trafficking occurs thousands of times each day at borders throughout the world, yet we have come to perceive it as something quite extraordinary. How did this happen, and what role does trafficking play in capitalism? To answer these questions, Johan Mathew traces the hidden networks that operated across the Arabian Sea in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Following the entangled history of trafficking and capitalism, he explores how the Arabian Sea reveals the gaps that haunt political borders and undermine economic models. Ultimately, he shows how capitalism was forged at the margins of the free market, where governments intervened, and traffickers turned a profit.</p><p>"This is a superb and vitally important book: conceptually sophisticated, imaginatively researched, and beautifully written. Johan Mathew brings into view the shifting networks of commerce around the Arabian Sea&#x2019;s littoral, forged in the shadows of imperial regulation&#x2014;a traffic in people, guns, and gold. This book is a breakthrough in Indian Ocean history, with huge contemporary resonance. And it is essential reading for anyone interested in the history of global capitalism."&#x2014;Sunil Amrith,&nbsp;Harvard University<br><br> "This brilliant book draws on unique primary sources and private archives to tell vivid stories, beautifully framed and theoretically rich, about the traffic in licit and illicit goods across the Arabian Sea. Its wonderful account of the smuggling of coins, guns, and humans, and also of the secret world of price-setting, shows how such trade is the shadowy other of more mundane forms of capital accumulation."&#x2014;Laleh Khalili, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London<br><br> "Johan Mathew's&nbsp;<i>Margins of the Market</i>&nbsp;provides a valuable corrective to the prevalent idea that trafficking and smuggling operate outside capitalism. Mathew shows, in vivid detail and with wide-ranging, in-depth research, how modern empires and nations around the Arabian Sea have struggled to frame the market inside a vast world of coercive profit making&#x2014;based on physical control of human beings, weapons, goods, and money&#x2014;whose expansive margins in fact provide capitalism much of its lucrative, adaptive dynamism."&#x2014;David Ludden, New York University<b>Johan Mathew </b>is Assistant Professor of History at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.<br><br></p><h2>George Cukor: A Double Life</h2><p>Through 50 years and 50 films--from "Holiday" and "The Philadelphia Story" to "Camille" and "My Fair Lady"--George Cukor created some of Hollywood's greatest motion pictures. The first book to discuss Cukor's homosexuality openly, "George Cukor: A Double Life" is a sympathetic portrait of a man "whose long career is all the more impressive given the double life he was forced to lead"--"Los Angeles Book Review". b&amp;w photos.</p><p>George Cukor is best known for directing witty comedies, but he also made wonderful dramas and musicals. He adapted many of his films from theatrical productions, but with such technical proficiency that they rarely felt stagy. In his long and productive career, he made classics such as <i>Camille</i>, <i>Holiday</i>, <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>, <i>Adam's Rib</i>, <i>A Star is Born</i>, and <i>My Fair Lady</i>. Patrick McGilligan's excellent biography gives the story behind the making of these and many other movies as well as terrific insights into Cukor's Jewish upbringing, his homosexuality, his reputation as a "woman's director," and his long-time association with Katharine Hepburn, with whom he made 10 films.<p><br>Patrick McGilligan&#x2019;s biographies include the Edgar-nominated <i>Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light</i> and <i>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.

Weiss offers new, ground-breaking information that you won&#39;t find anywhere else, providing practical step-by-step information that you can apply this year to improve your chances of seeing and taking bigger deer with larger antlers no matter where you hunt. Almost any habitat can be easily improved to attract and hold whitetails within its borders. This one-of-a-kind book is the absolute ultimate source on the subject of planting food plots to attract and hold deer, turkey, bear, upland birds, waterfowl and small game to the lands you hunt. It will become your bible on the subject. You will refer to it over and over again. It&#39;s destined to be a classic. Remember, even doing a little planting and management to improve your land is better than doing nothing at all!</p><p>Thirty years ago, John weiss allowed a neighbor to plant corn on his land in southeastern Ohio. In return, he was to receive a percentage of whatever the corn sold for at market. Instead, he told his friend, &#34;Leave my share standing in the field for the deer.&#34; That was his first food plot and he&#39;s been working with them, and benefiting all manner of wildlife, every year since. What he&#39;s learned has often been through simple trial and error. But mostly, his success has come from working with wildlife biologists, agronomists, and other hunter-landowners around the country, and his insight is sure to benefit your own efforts. Weiss holds a master&#39;s degree from Ohio University and a good deal of his hand-on research is conducted on his farm in Ohio where he lives with his wife, Marianne, and maintains numerous experimental food plots and clover plantings. He&#39;s written hundreds of articles for sportsmen and this is his nineteenth book.</p><h2>David Leadbetter&#39;s Faults and Fixes: How to Correct the 80 Most Common Problems in Golf</h2><p>A golf coach provides tips on improving one&#39;s golf game and correcting eighty of the most common mistakes made by beginners and experts alike</p><p>David Leadbetter is the guru particularly known for the way he's molded the games of the Nicks--Nick Price and Nick Faldo--to often breathtaking levels. <i>Faults and Fixes</i> is a perfectly pragmatic instructional.

Despite an enduring readership, however, she still remains in the shadow of her husband, Allen Tate, the Fugitive Poet and Agrarian critic, partially due to her contrived persona of a traditional southern lady turned artist under the tutelage of a gifted, benevolent male writer. Drawing on manuscript drafts, unpublished works, letters, and a significant body of her journalistic writing, Jonza investigates fully the causes and effects of Gordon&#x2019;s self-mythologizing and covers substantially more ground than the thirty years during which she was closest to Tate.</p><p>A little-known Caroline Gordon emerges from <i>The Underground Stream</i>. Her readers are sure to reach a deeper understanding of such aspects of Gordon&#x2019;s life and her art as her family&#x2019;s strong matriarchal tradition, her difficulties with pregnancy and motherhood, her conversion to Catholicism, her alcoholism, and her role within a sometimes destructive relationship with Allen Tate.</p></p><p>Nancylee Novell Jonza is an assistant professor of English at the University of St. Thomas in Houston.<p>Jonza belongs to a new generation of historians who have turned their attention to literary biography.

Just another addict, until Inspector Rebus begins to chip away at the indifference, treachery, deceit and sleaze that lurk behind the facade of the city familiar to tourists. And only Rebus seems to care about a death that looks more like murder every day, a death that appeals to the darkest corners of his mind.TOOTH &amp; NAIL: Drafted down to the Big Smoke thanks to a supposed expertise in the modus operandi of serial killers, Inspector Rebus is on the trail of a man who, due to his penchant for taking a bite from each of his victims, is known as the Wolfman. When Rebus is offered a profile of the Wolfman by an attractive lady psychologist, it seems too good an opportunity to turn down. But in finding an ally, he may have given his enemies an easy means of attack ...</p><p>Born in the Kingdom of Fife in 1960, Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982, and then spent three years writing novels when he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish Literature.

Justin Paperny, a former stockbroker from the previously distinguished firms of Merrill Lynch, Bear Sterns, and UBS, described the low road. When confronted with the choice of abiding by ethical principles, or protecting commissions generated by a ponzi scheme, Justin abused his discretion. He broke the law. Justin had been a child of privilege, growing up in Encino, an affluent Jewish enclave near Los Angeles. As a student athlete, he had been reared with self-discipline, integrity, and a sense of honor. These values carried him through prep school and the University of Southern California. Upon graduating, however, Justin succumbed to temptations, sacrificing virtues for greed. In Lessons from Prison, Justin offers his story, describing how serving a federal prison sentence led him to recalibrate his life. His narrative humanizes the importance of ethics. Those in corporate America as well as academia will find Justin&#39;s honesty a useful resource. Likewise, those struggling with legal complications may rely upon Justin&#39;s chronicles as a guide that will not only lead them through the labyrinth of the criminal justice system, but help them emerge stronger.</p><p></p><h2>Poppy and Ereth (Poppy, 7)</h2><p><p><strong>The sixth book in the beloved Poppy series by Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning author Avi, with illustrations from Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning artist Brian Floca</strong></p><p>Has Ereth lost Poppy forever?</p><p>Poppy, a deer mouse, has spent the long winter curled up inside her tree snag home in Dimwood Forest.

When they grow up they'd like to be "artists-in-residence at a nudist colony." If youthful voyeurism figures heavily in their everyday lives, so, too, do the pleasures of analogy, metaphor, and deliberate misprision. Sauntering into one store that dares to call itself MAN SHOP, Toni demands: "One man and two small boys, please." <p> Julian Barnes could probably fill several books with these boys' clever misadventures, but in his first novel he attempts something more daring--the curve from youthful scorn to adult contentment. In 1968, when Chris goes off to Paris, he misses the May <i>�v�nements</i> but manages, more importantly, to fall in love and learn the pleasures of openness: "The key to Annick's candour was that there was no key. It was like the atom bomb: the secret is that there is no secret." The final section finds Chris back in suburbia, married, with children and a mortgage, and slowly accepting the surprise that happiness isn't boring. "It's certainly ironic to be back in Metroland. As a boy, what would I have called it: <i>le syphilis de l'�me</i>, or something like that, I dare say. But isn't part of growing up being able to ride irony without being thrown?" Far from renouncing the joys of language, this novel wittily celebrates honest communication. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Only the author of Flaubert&#39;s Parrot could give us a novel that is at once a note-perfect rendition of the angsts and attitudes of English adolescence, a giddy comedy of sexual awakening in the 1960s, and a portrait of the accommodations that some of us call &#34;growing up&#34; and others &#34;selling out.&#34;</p><h2>The CIA and the cult of intelligence / by Victor Marchetti and John D.

Ever since, postmodernism has been haunted by the specter of a compromised past. In this intellectual genealogy of the postmodern spirit, Richard Wolin shows that postmodernism's infatuation with fascism has been widespread and not incidental. He calls into question postmodernism's claim to have inherited the mantle of the left--and suggests that postmodern thought has long been smitten with the opposite end of the political spectrum.</p><br><p>In probing chapters on C. G. Jung, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot, Wolin discovers an unsettling commonality: during the 1930s, these thinkers leaned to the right and were tainted by a proverbial "fascination with fascism." Frustrated by democracy's shortcomings, they were seduced by fascism's grandiose promises of political regeneration. The dictatorships in Italy and Germany promised redemption from the uncertainties of political liberalism. But, from the beginning, there could be no doubting their brutal methods of racism, violence, and imperial conquest.</p><br><p>Postmodernism's origins among the profascist literati of the 1930s reveal a dark political patrimony. The unspoken affinities between Counter-Enlightenment and postmodernism constitute the guiding thread of Wolin's suggestive narrative. In their mutual hostility toward reason and democracy, postmodernists and the advocates of Counter-Enlightenment betray a telltale strategic alliance--they cohabit the fraught terrain where far left and far right intersect.</p><br><p>Those who take Wolin's conclusions to heart will never view the history of modern thought in quite the same way.</p></p><p><p>"Richard Wolin's superb book is urgent reading for those who would toss the Enlightenment out with Descartes. In this tour d'horizon, as deep as it iswide, Wolin refuses to be impressed by the glamour of extremity. He shines light into many dark corners where intellectual fraud, self-deception, and hauteur passed for liberty during a murderous century. Talk about genealogy! Unreason will never be the same."--<b>Todd Gitlin, Columbia University, author of <i>The Twilight of Common Dreams</i></b></p><p>"Richard Wolin demonstrates conclusively that contempt for liberalism and parliamentary government, whether it comes from the right or the left, whether it is anti-modern or postmodern, is very bad politics. His learned and provocative 'genealogy' of contemporary anti-Americanism should cause deep anxiety among its intellectual purveyors in Europe and here at hometoo."--<b>Michael Walzer, Institute for Advanced Study</b></p><p>"I recommend this powerful critique with great enthusiasm. It is that infrequent book that is of enduring scholarly significance while deserving of a broad readership outside the academy. It also offers American readers insights into French and German mentalities at a time of transatlantic irritations."--<b>Jeffrey Herf, University of Maryland</b></p><p>"This is a wide-ranging and hard-hitting critique of postmodern thinking--especially of its political limitations and failures--based on broad reading and straight thinking. The author adds relevance to his critique of thinkers by juxtaposing those thinkers with interesting accounts of contemporary European politics."--<b>Jerrold Seigel, New York University</b></p><b>Richard Wolin</b> is Distinguished Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.

It explores how memories of the conflict have been filtered through specific cultural forms and political agendas, ranging from memorial painting and sculpture to representations of the destruction of bodies and landscape, and new aesthetic developments in art that offered ways of critiquing and reimagining postwar society. From the presentation of wounded war veterans to critiques of postwar corruption and poverty, <i>Aftermath</i> seeks to broaden the examination of war and memory beyond the modernist canon to show how both traditional and avant-garde art formed part of this process.</p><p><b>Emma Chambers</b> is curator, modern British art, at Tate.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Bringing Back the Black Robed Regiment: Volume 2</h2><p>They were prophets of liberty and truth. They bravely led their men onto the battlefield to face the cold steel of the dreaded Redcoats. They were hated and feared by the British who called them the &#34;&#34;Black Robed Regiment.&#34;&#34; Who were they? They were America&#39;s &#34;&#34;patriot preachers&#34;&#34; of the 18th century. Believing the Bible addressed every subject, including politics, wearing their black preaching robes, they boldly preached about spiritual and civil liberty. When the inevitable clash with the British came, they courageously defended liberty. Volume I of Bringing Back the Black Robed Regiment documents how these preachers courageously led their men onto the battlefield. Volume II explains the biblical convictions that motivated them to fight and shows how America will not survive without a rebirth of patriotism in the pulpit. &#34;&#34;This book is must reading for every pastor and Christian. Dan reminds us that without the pastor, there would have been no American Revolution and shows that, without the pastor, there will be no American Renewal in this generation.&#34;&#34; Rick Scarborough, Pres.

It was true.&nbsp;<br><br>Lord Sebastien Michael Boscastle, 1st Baron&nbsp;Boscastle of Wycliffe, was contemplating how to lure&nbsp;London&#x2019;s most notorious gentleman to his bed.&nbsp;He hadn&#x2019;t decided on the exact strategy he would&nbsp;use. But after three months of waiting for an invitation,&nbsp;he had decided that he&#x2019;d waited long enough.&nbsp;<br><br>Indeed, it tested his patience to walk, hop, and turn&nbsp;about until the two of them were re united in the&nbsp;ridiculous figures of the country reel. Only then, as&nbsp;they met, was he completely engaged.&nbsp;<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t say the same of his partner.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course it didn&#x2019;t help that the gentleman who&nbsp;had captured London&#x2019;s imagination happened to&nbsp;be his wife. She&#x2019;d captured him seven years ago and&nbsp;held his heart to this day. Everyone understood that&nbsp;the husband ought to maintain the upper hand in&nbsp;a marriage. Still, his wasn&#x2019;t the sort of problem he&nbsp;could discuss with the other officers at his club. God&nbsp;forbid anyone else found out.&nbsp;<br><br>The fact that his wife had scandalized the Polite&nbsp;World during their six unstable years as a married&nbsp;couple was a consequence he&#x2019;d been hoping to deal&nbsp;with on the quiet. Whether they had been officially&nbsp;estranged or not, it stung a man&#x2019;s pride, however,&nbsp;to hear that his wicked beloved had appeared in&nbsp;bedchambers all over town when she had studiously&nbsp;avoided the one bed in which she belonged.&nbsp;<br><br>His fingers flirted with the voluptuous curves of her&nbsp;breasts, then slid down her side, to her hip. She broke&nbsp;away. They made a circle. The next thing he knew,&nbsp;he was holding hands with a sweaty young col o nel.&nbsp;He shrugged in apology.&nbsp;<br><br>The colonel blushed.&nbsp;<br><br>The dance ended.&nbsp;<br><br>Sebastien bowed, searching for his wife as he&nbsp;straightened.&nbsp;<br><br>She was instantly encircled by chattering guests.&nbsp;He battled his way through the crush to her side.&nbsp;Unruffled, she gave him a smile that indicated she&nbsp;had the situation under control.&nbsp;<br><br>He wished he could say the same.&nbsp;<br><br>To look upon his comely baroness was to see a&nbsp;tall, curvaceous woman who visited libraries and&nbsp;attended parties, who had written one or two po liti&nbsp;cal pamphlets, and who wore rather outrageous&nbsp;costumes but who did not indulge in low gossip.&nbsp;Perhaps because everyone was gossiping about her.&nbsp;All the talk at the costume ball marking the last&nbsp;fortnight of London&#x2019;s Little Season was of the&nbsp;scoundrel known as the Mayfair Masquer. His escapades&nbsp;had invigorated a year remarkable only for&nbsp;debts and hailstorms. His elusive celebrity had captured&nbsp;the town&#x2019;s imagination at a time when Society&nbsp;desperately needed a distraction.&nbsp;<br><br>The ladies who braved Lord Trotten&#x2019;s <i>bal masqu�&nbsp;</i>that foggy October night professed alarm that his&nbsp;sightings had become more frequent. Their escorts&nbsp;vowed to protect these cherished gentlewomen in&nbsp;the event that the blackguard appeared in one of&nbsp;their boudoirs.&nbsp;<br><br>Which meant naturally that these gallant young&nbsp;defenders of virtue must first be ensconced behind&nbsp;the closed doors of their helpless damsels&#x2019; bedchambers&nbsp;in order to catch the fellow in the act.&nbsp;<br><br>In the act of what exactly was not understood.&nbsp;The saucy rapscallion had rifled through one or&nbsp;two desks, a writing cabinet, and several chests of&nbsp;drawers. He had taken nothing of value. Yet he offered&nbsp;the invaluable gift of entertainment, a spark of&nbsp;mischief, to create an amorous mood for those so inclined.&nbsp;He symbolized danger, yes, but also desire.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He stole a kiss from me while I was sleeping,&#x201d;&nbsp;one widow remarked.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How would you know, if you were asleep?&#x201d;&nbsp;asked an obviously envious younger lady.&nbsp;The widow smiled. &#x201c;My cheek still burns.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You are lying,&#x201d; the young lady said in a seething&nbsp;voice.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said the indolent rake who lived off&nbsp;the widow&#x2019;s largesse. &#x201c;I have only to lie beside her&nbsp;and I feel myself catch fire.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>None of the Masquer&#x2019;s alleged victims could describe&nbsp;him in helpful detail to the police. In fact,&nbsp;their reports so wildly contradicted one another that&nbsp;he could have been a dozen different men. To add to&nbsp;his air of mystery, varying accounts indicated that&nbsp;over the course of his exploits he had grown several&nbsp;feet in stature.&nbsp;<br><br>His physique had broadened. He had grown a&nbsp;beard. No&#x2014; his clean- shaven jaw was unmistakable.&nbsp;He had a dimple in his chin.&nbsp;<br><br>The first three ladies who claimed to have sighted&nbsp;him exiting their windows said he had left a peacock&nbsp;feather on their pillows. Soon after it became the&nbsp;rage to pin a peacock plume above one&#x2019;s heart to&nbsp;show support for . . . well, one couldn&#x2019;t say.&nbsp;<br><br>Was it wrong to harbor a secret tendresse for a&nbsp;wicked gentleman who truly had committed no&nbsp;harm? En gland was recovering from a devastating&nbsp;war. She needed romance.&nbsp;<br><br>So far every one of the Masquer&#x2019;s devoted victims&nbsp;had once been acclaimed by Society for either her&nbsp;beauty or sexual appeal. A fading blossom could not&nbsp;help perking up a little when the sun of public notice&nbsp;shone upon her again. To be chosen, after all this&nbsp;time, when one had settled for insignificance was&nbsp;more flattering than a lady could admit.&nbsp;<br><br>The single point on which everyone seemed to&nbsp;agree was that this intruder struck in the late eve -&nbsp;ning hours, when shadows drifted across time and&nbsp;dreams could not be discerned from waking truths.&nbsp;In those mists of magical perception he appeared&nbsp;and assumed what ever form a woman might most&nbsp;fear, or wish for. The delicate of heart could only&nbsp;shiver in wonder.&nbsp;<br><br>What would he do? What did the unsuspecting&nbsp;want him to do?&nbsp;<br><br>He had to be stopped.&nbsp;<br><br>Didn&#x2019;t he?&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he exists at all,&#x201d; one inebriated&nbsp;young blood had the stupidity to announce across a&nbsp;crowded antechamber where a lively conversation&nbsp;on the topic had broken out. The remark promptly&nbsp;ostracized him. He lacked imagination.&nbsp;<br><br>Impostors. Pretenders. Lovers and rivals.&nbsp;<br><br>Only two guests at the masquerade appreciated&nbsp;the delicious absurdity of this speculation. One&nbsp;was the husband of the Mayfair Masquer. Aside&nbsp;from this dubious distinction, Sebastien also held&nbsp;the secondary honor of being the only gentleman&nbsp;at the ball masquerading as Lord Whittington. The&nbsp;other guest in the know was his wife and distracted&nbsp;dancing partner, Eleanor. Costumed as Whittington&#x2019;s&nbsp;beloved cat, in a knee- length black cloak that&nbsp;swirled around tight broadcloth trousers and jack&nbsp;boots, she trod the floor with a gamely dignity that&nbsp;cast all the requisite princesses and pretty shepherdesses&nbsp;in a pale light.&nbsp;<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t taken his eyes off her all night. And&nbsp;not just because her beauty becharmed him.&nbsp;He&#x2019;d kept her in view because he didn&#x2019;t trust her&nbsp;not to get into trouble.&nbsp;<br><br>His lovely wife had stirred up a cauldron of the&nbsp;stuff while he was gone. She also happened to be&nbsp;the only woman who had ever stirred him. The light&nbsp;shed from the chandelier above enhanced the milky&nbsp;hue of her complexion. How innocent she looked,&nbsp;how subdued&#x2014; until one caught the dev ilish twinkle&nbsp;in her eye.&nbsp;<br><br>Sebastien appraised her in grudging amusement.&nbsp;Who would have guessed that his wife had sent so&nbsp;many other ladies into a swoon? Not that anyone&nbsp;had to convince him of her appeal. He could barely&nbsp;refrain from finishing the dance and whisking her&nbsp;off to a private spot. He hungered for her in whatever&nbsp;masquerade she chose. Whether she would admit&nbsp;to reciprocating his passion was uncertain at&nbsp;this point.&nbsp;<br><br>Until to night, he hadn&#x2019;t pressed the issue. But he&nbsp;needed her. Hang the masquerade. To hell with her&nbsp;faux mission. He wanted to be her husband again.&nbsp;She didn&#x2019;t seem to need him, though.&nbsp;<br><br>Her amber- brown eyes regarded him with a confidence&nbsp;that heated his blood. He remembered how&nbsp;enamored of him she&#x2019;d been when they had met in&nbsp;Spain. They had been married a little over six years&nbsp;ago. He&#x2019;d been away from En gland for three. But&nbsp;in the years since they had shared a bed, he had not&nbsp;touched another woman. Unfortunately in the few&nbsp;months since he&#x2019;d been home, he hadn&#x2019;t found the&nbsp;words to explain why he&#x2019;d abandoned her, either. If&nbsp;her trust in him was gone, he could only blame&nbsp;himself. And vow to do better if she&#x2019;d give him half&nbsp;a chance.&nbsp;<br><br>If she wouldn&#x2019;t, well, he would have to resort to&nbsp;other means.&nbsp;<br><br>After all, it wasn&#x2019;t a crime to covet one&#x2019;s own wife.&nbsp;Nor to seduce her. His pulses fired in anticipation.&nbsp;She&#x2019;d stolen his heart. He had broken hers.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You need to pay attention.&#x201d; She looked away.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost time.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I am paying attention,&#x201d; he retorted, as if they&nbsp;both didn&#x2019;t know where his thoughts had wandered.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Are my whis kers coming off?&#x201d; she whispered.&nbsp;He tucked a tendril of her hair back under her cap.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No. But&#x2014;&#x201d; He drew a breath, tortured by the&nbsp;yielding softness of her breasts against his arm.&nbsp;What kind of man wanted to make love to a&nbsp;woman with a coal- black nose and broomstick whiskers?&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you bear it,&#x201d; she said absently.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s driving me quite mad.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I know the cure,&#x201d; he said in a deep, suggestive&nbsp;voice.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d shave twice a day,&#x201d; she added, wriggling her&nbsp;nose.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d . . . what?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;The whis kers. I want to scratch at them so&nbsp;badly I could scream.&#x201d; Her voice was provocative&nbsp;and innocent at the same time. &#x201c;That is what you&nbsp;were talking about?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Her eyes glinted through the openings of her black&nbsp;silk mask. &#x201c;Is it too much to ask that you keep your&nbsp;mind on this assignment?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it too much to remind you that <i>I&#x2019;ve </i>been put in&nbsp;charge?&#x201d; he replied with a fleeting sense of victory.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I happen to be your superior.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Sebastien,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You surrendered that&nbsp;authority years ago.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I want it back.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to discuss this when we have work&nbsp;to do.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you telling <i>me </i>how to carry out this preposterous&nbsp;mission?&#x201d; he asked softly.&nbsp;<br><br>Her lips curled into an alluring smile. &#x201c;Are you&nbsp;able to stop staring at my tail long enough to succeed?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You were.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>His gaze wandered over her shapely form. &#x201c;Fine.&nbsp;I was.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew it,&#x201d; she whispered.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;And I will again,&#x201d; he promised her with a grin.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;At least wait until after we&#x2019;ve gotten the letter.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Now that sounded like an invitation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>The band launched into another set.&nbsp;<br><br>She danced around him, agile, evasive. &#x201c;Behave&nbsp;yourself, baron.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;It <i>was </i>an invitation.&#x201d; His blue eyes burned with&nbsp;confidence. &#x201c;And, by the way, I accept.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He realized that she doubted him when he swore&nbsp;he&#x2019;d make up for not being a decent husband.

The Communist s Tet Offensive had been soundly defeated some four months previously and with that offensive had died the indigenous Viet Cong. The continuing inflow of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops was now even more crucial for the Communists pursuit of the war. The Viet Cong battalions were soon filled with these Northern-born conscripts, trained in conventional warfare and unfamiliar with the southern terrain in which they operated. The former guerrilla war essentially ceased. <br>The huge North Vietnamese Army also continued in its attempts to invade its southern neighbor in its own 10,000-man division-sized units heavily armed with artillery and even tanks. The NVA had the luxury of operating from neutral Laos and Cambodia, and free from attack. To defend this 800-mile border, the American and South Vietnamese Army established a string of border outposts intended to signal the NVA presence and allow an American counter-attack once these enemy troops entered the South. Most American troops were required in the enormous logistic tail necessary to fight a war 10,000 miles from home. Comparatively few units were available for this mobile mission. These few were referred to as maneuver battalions because they were able to take the war to the enemy.<br>In May, 1968 American casualties were running as high as 500 men killed in action in a week. The huge majority of these casualties, fully 80% of them, was being borne by that small handful of troops in the maneuver battalions. These battalions never numbered over fifty, with an average field strength of about 500 men each. Thus, while American peak strength in the war was almost 500,000 troops, 80% of the casualties were being suffered by the 25,000 men who fought in the maneuver battalions. <br><br>One such maneuver battalion was the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. This is the story of one of their battles, told by the veterans themselves. The battle began on May 28, 1968 when the 88 Marines of Foxtrot Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment were engaged by an NVA battalion of over 500 men near Khe Sanh. The resulting fight, has come to be known as the Battle of Foxtrot Ridge. The fighting, much of it in pre-dawn darkness was fierce and confusing. When it was over, the Marines had suffered 13 men killed and 44 wounded, killing 230 of the enemy during the nine-hour battle. At times filled with the physical sights, sounds, and smells of battle, while at other times, overtaken by pure emotion, Foxtrot Ridge is a unique and powerful view of war. <br><br>The battle of Foxtrot Ridge was not a deciding battle, it was not special or unique, and remains only a footnote in most histories of the war. Yet it was battles like this, fierce battles fought at the 100-man company level, that tell the real story of the American fighting man in Vietnam. Taken as a group the battles were the Vietnam War.</p><p>Mark William Woodruff was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and is the author of the highly-regarded Vietnam history, Unheralded Victory (Vandamere Press, 2000). The author enlisted in the Marine Corps in July 1967; completed his Boot Camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego; and took Infantry and Advanced Training at Camp Pendleton. He served in Vietnam with Foxtrot Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment from December 1967 to December 1968.After leaving the Marine Corps, he graduated from Pepperdine University (Los Angeles) in 1970 with a B.A. in Psychology, receiving his M.A. in Psychology from Pepperdine in 1971. In 1973 he moved to Australia and began a career as an Educational Psychologist in Western Australia. He holds a reserve commission with the Royal Australian Navy as a Psychology Officer and has also worked with the Australian Vietnam Veterans Counseling Service in Perth. Currently, he is a Senior Navy Psychologist at Fleet Base West in Western Australia.On an insignificant ridge pocked with bomb craters some nine miles west of Khe Sanh, the marines of Foxtrot Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment fought a furious nine-hour battle on May 28, 1968, against 500 North Vietnamese regulars. As a result, 13 marines were killed and 44 wounded, while the North Vietnamese lost over 230 men. The intensive, bloody fighting in the surrounding area went on for another three months, owing to the heavy concentration of NVA troops. Written in narrative form and drawing on personal interviews with survivors of the battle, Woodruff's book reads almost like an after-action report, showing the steps of the ensuing NVA assault and the defense the besieged marines took as the battle intensified. The constant assaults on the ridge and individual acts of heroism by the marines, against tall odds, are well depicted. Reminiscent of Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway's We Were Soldiers Once and Young, this account by a Foxtrot veteran and author (Unheralded Victory) will be added to the study and history of the war that caused America so much internal strife and loss of life.

Both ship and master were veterans and had already sailed in convoys across the North Atlantic and to South Africa. The 5,395 ton coal fired ship, laden with 8,000 tons of armaments originally set sail on 27 November 1941 to join convoy PQ6 but encountered a fierce storm in which a lorry broke free in the hold and started a fierce blaze below decks. Despite valiant attempts to extinguish the fire the Harmatris was forced to return to Glasgow for repair. Having discharged its cargo, examined and repaired the holds, it restowed and finally put to sea again on 26 December. She was now to join PQ8 and Brundle was elected Convoy Commodore. Two minesweepers, a cruiser and two destroyers escorted the eight merchant vessels.On 8 January the convoy left Reykjavik bound for Murmansk. Harmatris was struck by two torpedoes in No 1 hold which caused flooding. A third torpedo struck her a few hours later and the crew evacuated to HMS Speedwell in attendance. A volunteer crew reboarded and Speedwell took the wounded ship in tow. During the night the same U Boat that had struck Harmatris sunk the destroyer Matabele with the loss of all but two of her crew. A tug eventually replaced Speedwell and the entire crew now returned to their still stricken vessel. On 18 January the ships were twice attacked by low flying Heinkels. The stricken Harmatris finally berthed in Murmansk at 0800 on 20 January. Once unloaded the battered ship entered dry dock on 10 February. The damage was considerable. In a temperature of 40 degrees below zero the crew set about the repairs. It was difficult to locate engine parts and local labor was scarce.During the following months the crew continued to work on the ship, food was scarce and the port was frequently bombed by the Luftwaffe. Several ships close to Harmatris were sunk. It was 21 July when the ship finally left for Archangel. She took aboard a cargo of 3,000 tons of steel pipes and on 13 September she was instructed to join a convoy of 20 ships, QP14 for her return voyage. On 19 September the minesweeper HMS Leda, steaming close by Harmartris, was torpedoed. The convoy was under almost continuous U Boat attack and suffered six losses. As a result of his heroic efforts to preserve his ship and crew Captain Brundle was awarded the OBE and the Lloyds War Medal. He died in 1960 at the age of 66.</p><p></p><h2>Unbroken Thread: An Anthology of Plays by Asian American Women</h2><p>This book contains plays by Genny Lim (<i>Paper Angels</i>,) Wakako Yamauchi (<i>The Music</i> <i>Lessons,) Momoko Iko (Gold Watch,) Velina Hasu Houston (Tea</i>,) Jeannie Barroga (<i>Walls</i>,) and Elizabeth Wong (<i>Letters to a Student Revolutionary</i>.)

Kacyzne's assignment was to become a ten-year journey across "Poyln," as Poland's three million Yiddish-speaking Jews called their home, from the crowded ghettos of Warsaw and Krakow to the remote villages of Otwock and Kazimierz. Candid and intimate, tender and humorous, Kacyzne's portraits-- of teeming village squares and primitive workshops, cattle markets and spinning wheels, prayer groups and summer camps-- tell the story of a way of life that is no more.<br><br>For the last sixty years, Kacyzne's <i>Forverts</i> photographs-- the sole fragment of his vast archive to survive World War II-- lay unseen. Now the work of this lost master is restored to the world in a volume of extraordinary force and beauty.<br></p><p>Born in 1885 in Vilna, <b>Alter Kacyzne</b> was a Yiddish poet, dramatist, journalist, and editor, as well as a photographer.

Why has this occurred, and what relation do these shows have to society's idea of "blackness"? How do these shows relate to earlier television series featuring African Americans? Herman Gray's Watching Race -- now available in paperback for the first time -- offers a new look at the changing representations of African Americans on television.</p><p>Starting with the portrayal of blacks on series such as The Jack Benny Show and Amos 'n' Andy, Gray details the ongoing dialogue between television representations and cultural discourse to show how the meaning of blackness has changed through the years of the TV era. Drawing on analyses of The Cosby Show, Frank's Place, In Living Color, and Roc, as well as music videos, news coverage, and advertising, Watching Race examines how the political stakes, cultural perspectives, and social locations of key cultural and social formations influence the representation of "blackness" in television.</p><p>"Absorbing....

Drawing on six years of in-depth, systematic, worldwide research, they present proven principles for developing the critical capabilities for speed, efficiency, and quality that have worked again and again in scores of successful Japanese, American, and European fast-cycle firms. <p> The authors argue that to survive, let alone succeed, today's companies must construct a new "platform" -- with new methodologies -- on which they can compete. Using their model for development strategies, Wheelwright and Clark show that firms can create a solid architecture for the integration of marketing, manufacturing, and design functions for problem solving and fast action -- particularly during the critical design-build-test cycles of prototype creation. </p><p> They demonstrate further how successful firms such as Honda in automobiles, Compaq in personal computers, Applied Materials in semi-conductors, Sony in audio equipment, The Limited in apparel, and Hill-Rom in hospital beds have employed recent methodologies to bring new products to market at break-neck speed. Such innovations include design for manufacturability, quality function deployment, computer-aided design, and computer-aided engineering. </p><p> Finally, Wheelwright and Clark emphasize the importance of learning in the organization. Companies that consistently "design it right the first time" and follow a path of continuous improvement in product and process development have a formidable edge in the crucial race to market.</p></p><p>Steven C.

Hayes of the best-selling <i>Dynamic Manufacturing</i> (Free Press, 1988).</p><p> <b>Chapter 1: <i>Competing Through Development Capability</i></b> </p><p> In a competitive environment that is global, intense, and dynamic, the development of new products and processes increasingly is a focal point of competition. Firms that get to market faster and more efficiently with products that are well matched to the needs and expectations of target customers create significant competitive leverage. Firms that are slow to market with products that match neither customer expectations nor the products of their rivals are destined to see their market position erode and financial performance falter. In a turbulent environment, doing product and process development well has become a requirement for being a player in the competitive game; doing development extraordinarily well has become a competitive advantage. </p><p> <b><i>The New Industrial Competition: Driving Forces and Development Realities</i></b> </p><p> The importance of product and process development is not limited to industries or businesses built around new scientific findings, with significant levels of R&amp;D spending, or where new products have traditionally accounted for a major fraction of annual sales. The forces driving development are far more general. Three are particularly critical: </p><p> <i>* Intense international competition.</i> In business after business, the number of competitors capable of competing at a world-class level has grown at the same time that those competitors have become more aggressive. As world trade has expanded and international markets have become more accessible, the list of one's toughest competitors now includes firms that may have grown up in very different environments in North America, Europe, and Asia. The effect has been to make competition more intense, demanding, and rigorous, creating a less forgiving environment. </p><p> <i>* Fragmented, demanding markets.</i> Customers have grown more sophisticated and demanding. Previously unheard of levels of performance and reliability are today the expected standard. Increasing sophistication means that customers are more sensitive to nuances and differences in a product, and are attracted to products that provide solutions to their particular problems and needs. Yet they expect these solutions in easy-to-use forms. </p><p> <i>* Diverse and rapidly changing technologies.</i> The growing breadth and depth of technological and scientific knowledge has created new options for meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse and demanding market. The development of novel technologies and a new understanding of existing technologies increases the variety of possible solutions available to engineers and marketers in their search for new products. Furthermore, the new solutions are not only diverse, but also potentially transforming. New technologies in areas such as materials, electronics, and biology have the capacity to change fundamentally the character of a business and the nature of competition. </p><p> These forces are at work across a wide range of industries. They are central to competition in young, technically dynamic industries, but also affect mature industries where life cycles historically were relatively long, technologies mature, and demands stable. In the world auto industry, for example, the growing intensity of international competition, exploding product variety, and diversity in technology have created a turbulent environment. The number of world-scale competitors has grown from less than five in the early 1960s to more than twenty today. But perhaps more importantly, those twenty competitors come from very different environments and possess a level of capability far exceeding the standard prevailing twenty-five years ago. Much the same is true of customers. Levels of product quality once considered extraordinary are now a minimum requirement for doing business. As customers have grown more sophisticated and demanding, the variety of products has increased dramatically. In the mid 1960s, for example, the largest selling automobile in the United States was the Chevrolet Impala. The platform on which it was based sold approximately 1.5 million units per year. In 1991, the largest selling automobile in the United States was the Honda Accord, which sold about 400,000 units. Thus, in a market that is today larger than it was in 1965, the volume per model has dropped by a factor of four. Currently over 600 different automobile models are offered for sale on the U.S. market. </p><p> Similarly, technological change has had dramatic consequences. In 1970, one basic engine-drive train technology (a V8 engine, longitudinally mounted, water cooled, carbureted, hooked up to a three-speed automatic transmission with rear wheel drive) accounted for close to 80 percent of all automobile production in the United States. Indeed, there were only five engine-drive train technologies in production. By the early 1980s that number had grown to thirty-three. The growing importance of electronics, new materials, and new design concepts in engines, transmissions, suspensions, and body technologies has accelerated the pace and diversity of technological change in the 1980s. Simply keeping up with those technologies is a challenge, but an often straightforward one in comparison with having to integrate them in development efforts. </p><p> Similar forces have been at work in other traditional, mature industries. In textiles and apparel, for example, firms such as Benetton and The Limited have used information technology to create a production and distribution network which links retail outlets directly to distribution centers and back into factories and suppliers in the chain of production from fiber to finished product. The thrust of these networks is the ability to respond quickly to changing customer demands at relatively low cost. Fueled in part by availability and in part by growing demands for differentiated products, product variety has expanded significantly. In plant after plant, one finds vast increases in the number of styles produced and a sharp decline in the length of production runs. These are not changes of 10 or 20 percent; in the 1980s, it was common for apparel plants to experience a four- to fivefold increase in the number of styles produced. These increases in garment variety have pushed back into the textile plants as well. For example, the average lot size for dying at Greenwood Mills, a U.S. textile firm, declined in the 1980s from 120,000 to 11,000 yards. </p><p> Changes in markets and technologies for automobile and textile firms have accentuated the importance of speed and variety in product development. But changes in competition, customer demand, and technology have also had dramatic effects on newer, less mature industries in which product innovation has always been an important part of competition. In industries such as computer disk drives and medical equipment, already short life cycles have shrunk further and product variety has increased. In addition, competition has placed increased pressure on product reliability and product cost. In disk drives, for example, the market for Winchester-technology hard disks has expanded from a base in high-end systems for mainframe computers to include a spectrum of applications ranging from notebook personal computers to large-scale supercomputers. Even within an application segment, the number of sizes, capacities, access times, and features has increased sharply. In addition to this <i>explosion of variety,</i> firms in the hard disk drive industry have had to meet demands for <i>dramatic increases in reliability</i> (tenfold in five years) and <i>decreases in cost</i> (5 percent to 8 percent quarterly). These have been met in part by incremental improvements in established technologies and in part through the introduction of new design concepts, production technologies, materials, and software. </p><p> Much the same has been true in the market for new medical devices. Innovation has always been important in the creation of new medical devices, but by the 1980s success required the ability to follow an innovative product with sustained improvements in performance, application to new segments, improved reliability, and lower cost. In the case of devices for angioplasty (a procedure using a balloon on a small wire to expand clogged arteries), the initial innovation was followed by a variety of developments that offered the physician greater control of a smaller device, making access easier and creating additional applications. In concert with process changes that substantially improved or reduced variability of performance characteristics, changes in the product have opened up new applications and treatment of a more diverse set of clinical problems and patients, worldwide. </p><p> <b>The Competitive Imperatives</b> </p><p> Rigorous international competition, the explosion of market segments and niches, and accelerating technological change have created a set of competitive imperatives for the development of new products and processes in industries as diverse as medical instruments and automobiles, textiles, and high-end disk drives. Exhibit 1-1 identifies three of these imperatives -- speed, efficiency, and quality -- and suggests some of their implications. To succeed, firms must be responsive to changing customer demands and the moves of their competitors. This means that they must be fast. The ability to identify opportunities, mount the requisite development effort, and bring to market new products and processes quickly is critical to effective competition. But firms also must bring new products and processes to market efficiently. Because the number of new products and new process technologies has increased while model lives and life cycles have shrunk, firms must mount more development projects than has traditionally been the case utilizing substantially fewer resources per project. In the U.S. automobile market, for example, the growth of models and market segments over the last twenty-five years has meant that an auto firm must mount close to four times as many development projects simply to maintain its market share position. But smaller volumes per model and shorter design lives mean resource requirements must drop dramatically. Effective competition requires highly efficient engineering, design, and development activities. </p><p> Being fast and efficient is essential but not enough. The products and processes that a firm introduces must also meet demands in the market for value, reliability, and distinctive performance. Demanding customers and capable competitors mean that the ante keeps going up -- requirements of performance, reliability, ease of use, and total value increase with each product introduction. When competition is intense firms must attract and satisfy customers in a very crowded market. More and more this means offering a product that is distinctive; that not only satisfies, but also surprises and delights a customer. Moreover, attention to the total product experience and thus to total product quality is critical. </p><p> <b>The Opportunity and the Challenge</b> </p><p> Firms that step up to the challenge and meet these competitive imperatives enjoy a significant advantage in the market place. The development of outstanding products not only opens new markets and attracts new customers, but also leverages existing assets and builds new capability in the organization. Getting a succession of distinctive new disk drives or a string of new medical devices to market quickly and consistently requires the solution of technical problems that builds know-how. Moreover, it stimulates the creation of greater capability in problem solving, prototype construction, and testing that can be applied in future projects. All of these skills and capabilities enhance a firm's ability to compete. But there is more. Successful new products also unleash a virtuous cycle in reputation and enthusiasm within and outside the organization. Inside, successful new products energize the organization; confidence, pride, and morale grow. The best employees remain challenged and enthused. Outside, outstanding new products create broad interest in the firm and its products, enhance the firm's ability to recruit new employees, and facilitate the building of relationships with other organizations. The organization's momentum builds and reinforces itself. </p><p> While the potential opportunities to be realized in developing new products and processes are exciting, making them happen is a demanding challenge. New product or process development entails a complex set of activities that cuts across most functions in a business, as suggested by Exhibit 1-2, which lays out the phases of activity in a typical development project -- a new product. In the first two phases -- concept development and product planning -- information about market opportunities, competitive moves, technical possibilities, and production requirements must be combined to lay down the architecture of the new product. This includes its conceptual design, target market, desired level of performance, investment requirements, and financial impact. Before a new product development program is approved, firms also attempt to prove out the concept through small-scale testing, the construction of models, and, often, discussions with potential customers. </p><p> Once approved, a new product project moves into detailed engineering. The primary activity in this phase of development is the design and construction of working prototypes and the development of tools and equipment to be used in commerical production. At the heart of detailed product and process engineering is the "design-build-test" cycle. Both products and processes are laid out in concept, captured in a working model (which may exist on a computer or in physical form), and then subjected to tests that simulate product use. If the model fails to deliver the desired performance characteristics, engineers search for design changes that will close the gap and the design-build-test cycle is repeated. The conclusion of the detailed engineering phase of development is marked by an engineering "release" or "sign off" that signifies that the final design meets requirements. </p><p> At this time the firm typically moves development into a pilot manufacturing phase, during which the individual components, built and tested on production equipment, are assembled and tested as a system in the factory. During pilot production many units of the product are produced and the ability of the new or modified manufacturing process to execute at a commerical level is tested. At this stage all commercial tooling and equipment should be in place and all parts suppliers should be geared up and ready for volume production. This is the point in development at which the total system -- design, detailed engineering, tools and equipment, parts, assembly sequences, production supervisors, operators, and technicians -- comes together. </p><p> The final phase of development is ramp-up. The process has been refined and debugged, but has yet to operate at a sustained level of high-yield, volume production. In ramp-up the firm starts commerical production at a relatively low level of volume; as the organization develops confidence in its (and its suppliers') abilities to execute production consistently and marketing's abilities to se...</p></p><h2>A Country Escape</h2><p>Twenty-seven-year-old Fran protests that she always wanted to be a farmer, so quite how Fran ended up as a chef in London is anyone's guess.

With customary charm and deftness, Alexander McCall Smith gives us another installment in this popular series, now running in its ninth season in the Scotsman. Anything could happen to Bertie and the gang...</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is one of the world&#39;s most prolific and most popular authors. For many years he was a professor of Medical Law, then, after the publication of his highly successful No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency series, which has sold over twenty-five million copies, he devoted his time to the writing of fiction and has seen his various series of books translated into over forty-six languages and become bestsellers throughout the world. These include the 44 Scotland Street novels, first published as a serial novel in the Scotsman, the Isabel Dalhousie novels, the Von Igelfeld series and the Corduroy Mansions novels.Beer and Knees<br><br>On any Friday evening, the Cumberland Bar, just round the corner from Drummond Place and Scotland Street, might be expected to be busy, the meeting place of assorted mercantile tribes, of office workers from further down the hill, of young accountants, of estate agents and lawyers, and, conspicuous by their less formal attire, of some of the more bohemian, the more artistic inhabitants of this eastern corner of Edinburgh&#x2019;s Georgian New Town. At least two of this last group were present early that evening&#x2014;Angus Lordie, portrait painter and owner of the dog, Cyril, and his friend, Matthew, proprietor of a small art gallery on Dundas Street, husband of Elspeth, and father of the robust and increasingly rumbustious triplets, Tobermory, Rognvald, and Fergus. Cyril, the only dog in Scotland to have a gold tooth, and the only dog anywhere to have been trained to lift his leg at the mention of the controversial conceptual art award, the Turner Prize, was also there, lying contentedly beneath the table at which Matthew and Angus sat. Underneath this table was to be seen an empty metal bowl, licked clean of the dark stout poured into it only ten minutes earlier, and the consumption of which had induced Cyril&#x2019;s state of somnolent contentment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your dog,&#x201d; observed Matthew, &#x201c;really is a most peculiar creature. I&#x2019;ve never quite worked him out, you know. He keeps looking at me in a distinctly disconcerting way.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus glanced down at Cyril. Although one of the dog&#x2019;s eyes was closed, he saw that the other, half-open, was focused on Matthew&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if he had something against me,&#x201d; Matthew continued. &#x201c;Some canine grudge perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think Cyril dislikes you. Quite the opposite, in fact.&#x201d; Angus smiled at Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that he&#x2019;s always had this thing about your ankles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He nipped me,&#x201d; said Matthew accusingly. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That was when he couldn&#x2019;t control himself any further. He yielded to temptation.&#x201d; Angus paused, ready to defend his dog. &#x201c;We all have our temptations, don&#x2019;t we? Some hidden desire, something we&#x2019;re perhaps a bit ashamed of. Nobody&#x2019;s immune to that.&#x201d; He paused again, before concluding, &#x201c;Chocolate . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew stared at Angus. He blushed. He had yielded to temptation only that afternoon, eating an entire bar of expensive Belgian chocolate bought by his assistant, Pat, as a birthday present for Elspeth. The chocolate had been entrusted to him, beautifully wrapped, for delivery to Elspeth, and he had sat and gazed at it, struggling with temptation, until at last he had succumbed. He had then eaten it in a single sitting when Pat went to post some letters, afterwards concealing the wrapping in the drawer of his desk. He had told himself that he would replace it in good time and that Elspeth would never know. But it was, he later decided, an entirely shameful thing to do&#x2014;no different from the act of a postman who steals a parcel, or a charity collector who pockets donations. Was it possible that Angus had guessed what he had done? That seemed so unlikely, and yet why else would he suddenly bring chocolate into the conversation?<br><br>He dismissed his scruples; it was hardly anything to get into a fankle over, hardly an issue at all . . . chocolate was a fungible, after all; something that could be replaced by more of the same. A fankle&#x2014;the Scots word seemed just right for its purpose, as so many Scots words did; a fankle was a mess, a state of confusion, sometimes leading to a stramash&#x2014;another useful Scots word&#x2014;and it was something one sought to avoid if at all possible.<br><br>Angus raised his glass to his lips. Having broached the topic of temptation, he was keen to abandon the subject. He himself experienced the occasional temptation&#x2014;nothing serious, of course, and barely anti-social&#x2014;but he was not sure that he would actually own up to such thoughts. Better, though, to think about something else altogether, which was, of course, a recommended way of tackling temptation in the first place.<br><br>But it was Matthew who moved the conversation on. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Be that as it may, have you seen the plans for that new building?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus had, and sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think . . .&#x201d; he began, and then stopped. There was not much one could add, he felt, to the charges of gross Philistinism that had already been levelled at the developers.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Matthew, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d think, wouldn&#x2019;t you? How�ever, I just don&#x2019;t have the energy to protest. I know I should; I know we should all rise up as one and flood the council with objections, but do they care? Does anyone actually imagine they give any weight to the likes of us, Angus? Les citoyens?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus thought for a moment, and then answered, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So perhaps we should just give the matter a Gallic shrug . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked puzzled. &#x201c;A Gallic shrug?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The French are always shrugging,&#x201d; explained Matthew. &#x201c;You ask their view on things and they give a sort of insouciant shrug, as if to say that these things happen and they, at least, are completely unsurprised.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus knew what Matthew meant. He remembered a visit that he and Domenica had been paid by a French anthropologist a few months previously. The topic of French politics had cropped up in the conversation&#x2014;there was a long and crippling strike in France, with the government digging in against virtually everybody&#x2014;and the French visitor had simply shrugged. Pouf! he had said, adding, for clarification, Bif!<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps a shrug is not such a bad response,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the alternative? Getting all steamed up? Hot under the collar? You end up being angry&#x2014;outraged even&#x2014;but does that actually do any good?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew himself was about to shrug, but stopped in time. One could not pronounce on shrugs with a shrug. &#x201c;I suppose that a shrug indicates acceptance,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is what we should all cultivate,&#x201d; added Angus. &#x201c;Those who accept things are calmer, more resolved . . . and, I imagine, live much longer than those who rail against them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t abide moaning,&#x201d; said Angus, taking a sip of his beer. &#x201c;Moaning gets us nowhere. It confirms the moaner in his state of discontent, and it irritates those who have to listen to the complaints.&#x201d; He paused, and looked enquiringly at Matthew. &#x201c;Have I told you about my knee?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having knee trouble?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; said Angus. He looked at his beer glass, half full, with an expression of regret. &#x201c;I can only have one beer; you know&#x2014;because of my knee.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;Because of your knee?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus told him. &#x201c;You see what happened,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;is this . . .&#x201d;<br><br>*<br><br>News of Bruce<br><br>&#x201c;I first noticed it,&#x201d; said Angus, &#x201c;when I was driving up to St. Fillans. We have friends there, you see. Actually, she&#x2019;s some sort of cousin of Domenica&#x2019;s, and he used to manage a branch of the Bank of Scotland in the days when banks had proper managers in their branches&#x2014;somebody you could actually speak to.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember our wonderful, solid, Presbyterian banks, Angus?&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Who wrecked our banks? Who actually did it? And I don&#x2019;t mean who lost the money by gambling on toxic mortgages and things like that, but who actually decreed that we shouldn&#x2019;t be able to speak to anybody if we phoned the branch? Or who said that banks needn&#x2019;t answer letters their customers wrote to them? Who ended the idea that banks actually supported people through rough times? Who ended all that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People down in the City of London,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Avari�cious, arrogant people. I have a list of them somewhere. I cut it out of the newspaper. But, as I was saying . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course&#x2014;as you were saying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were driving up to St. Fillans, going by way of Comrie. You know that back road that goes from Braco&#x2014;up over the hills?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew thought for a second before he remembered. As a sixteen-year-old boy he had gone to cadet camp during the summer and they had been driven in an ancient green army truck along that winding road, half looking forward to, half dreading the experience ahead: the tepid, frequently cold, showers, the rough camaraderie of the Nissen huts, the bullying (both subtle and unsubtle), the shouting and the crudity of males living in close proximity to one another for a week or more. &#x201c;Past Cultybraggan Camp?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; said Angus. And he, too, remembered what that had been like in his own day. For a moment there was an additional bond between them, a bond that surpassed the ordinary ties of friendship, a bond based on a shared tribal experience. He continued, &#x201c;It was on that road, just as it begins to drop down sharply towards Comrie&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when I felt this pain in my knee. I thought I&#x2019;d pulled something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You often don&#x2019;t notice it when you actually pull the muscle,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;Then later on the pain starts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was quite intense,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It was a sharp, insistent pain. Quite bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it got steadily worse after we got to St. Fillans. That night I found it difficult to bend my knee at all. It was hard to get into bed&#x2014;I had to sit on the edge of the mattress and then swing the useless leg up. It was far from easy.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head in sympathy. &#x201c;Poor you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were due to come back to Edinburgh the following afternoon, but we cut our trip short and drove back the next morning. Domenica drove, in fact, as I couldn&#x2019;t move my leg. It was that painful.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew waited. He was thinking of Cultybraggan Camp and the generations of young men who had passed through it, for some of whom, of course, it had been the prelude to real conflict, to war with real explosives rather than the fireworks their instructors used to simulate explosions.<br><br>Angus continued his story. &#x201c;I saw my doctor in Edinburgh and he prescribed a pretty strong anti-inflammatory. Cyril had something similar from the vet when he caught his front paw in a drain cover. It did the trick for me. I also had a blood test.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; prompted Matthew.<br><br>Angus looked morose, and Matthew wondered whether he was about to hear bad news; Angus did not look unwell, but then seriously ill people could often look perfectly healthy.<br><br>&#x201c;Gout,&#x201d; muttered Angus.<br><br>Matthew was relieved. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He did not finish.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no joke,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;People make light of it, you know. They know that gout often goes for the big toe, and they find that amusing, for some reason. But it can flare up in other joints.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew started to grin, but checked himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, the diagnosis is not definite,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Apparently the only way in which you can really confirm gout is to stick a needle into the joint and see if there&#x2019;s any sign of uric acid crystals.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew, being squeamish, made a face.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s crystals that cause it,&#x201d; Angus continued. &#x201c;They form if your uric acid level is too high. They&#x2019;re shaped like needles&#x2014;hence the pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And how do they treat it?&#x201d; asked Matthew.<br><br>Angus&#x2019;s face fell again. &#x201c;There are pills you can take,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They neutralise the uric acid. But you can also treat it by avoiding the foods that cause it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there you are,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;Which means cutting out everything I like the most,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;Seafood, steak, red wine and . . .&#x201d; He pointed to his glass of beer. &#x201c;This stuff too.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew sympathised. &#x201c;Oh, bad luck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was given a leaflet published by the British Gout Society,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It tells you about all the foods you have to avoid&#x2014;or, if you must, eat in moderation.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew could not help but imagine meetings of the British Gout Society. &#x201c;The British Gout Society,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Do you think they have an annual dance, like other societies?&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Can you imagine how much fun that would be?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked at him reproachfully. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t find that at all funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And anybody can get it, you know. Not just men who drink port in clubs . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew assumed a serious expression. &#x201c;Of course. Sorry.&#x201d; The problem, he thought, was that so much humour involved human misfortune of one sort or another, and now that same human misfortune was out of bounds&#x2014;interdicted by self-appointed guardians of sensitivity. There was somebody to be offended by everything, he thought, which left little room for laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t making light of it, Angus. It&#x2019;s just that the name of the society . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus waved a hand. &#x201c;No, I know that. And I&#x2019;m not hyper-sensitive. But I don&#x2019;t think people should make light of gout. People don&#x2019;t laugh at other conditions.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew knew Angus was right, and decided that another change of subject was called for.<br><br>&#x201c;Bruce,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw him the other day, you know. He&#x2019;s back in circulation&#x2014;with a new Australian girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor girl,&#x201d; said Angus.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;If sympathy is called for,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it should be directed towards Bruce. He&#x2019;s the one I feel sorry for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Poor girl. Does she have any idea what he&#x2019;s like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect she does,&#x201d; replied Matthew. &#x201c;If I had to describe her eyes, I think I&#x2019;d use the expression wide open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Doe-eyed?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Far from it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Hey Diddle Diddle &amp; Other Mother Goose Rhymes</h2><p>Tomie dePaola's whimsical and winning illustrations bring to life an enchanting selection of 48 Mother Goose songs and rhymes from the highly acclaimed Tomie dePaola's Mother Goose. <br><br>Praise for <i>Tomie dePaola's Mother Goose</i>:<br>"From start to finish, a treasure house of delight.

This second novel in his planned trilogy continues the chilling drama of life in the Soviet Union just after Khrushchev&#39;s purge of Stalin in 1956. Protagonist Leo Demidov is an ex-security officer during a time when it is dangerous to have been one of Stalin&#39;s minions.

Now the priest&#39;s wife has every intention of killing Demidov&#39;s daughter if he does not get her husband released from the gulag. Dennis Boutsikaris&#39;s Russian accents are superb. He brings even minor characters to life and portrays sex and age differences credibly.

While much has been written on feminism and therapy, this bold book breaks new ground by making explicit and coherent the theoretical underpinnings of feminist therapy.Building on the revolutionary work of feminist scholars who have described how women employ strategies of knowing the world in a manner distinct from men, Laura S. Brown, noted for her pioneering work in the field of ethics and boundaries, shows how these insights should reshape the very nature of the therapeutic encounter. Therapy must be understood as an opportunity to help clients see the relationships between their behavior and the patriarchal society in which we are all embedded. Viewed in this light, feminist therapy affords both practitioner and client a chance to subvert the system in which women's lives have been devalued.With meticulous care, the author examines key features of the therapeutic encounter with a feminist lens: the power of the therapist; assessment and diagnosis; the nature of change; the ethics of practice; and differences in race, class, and sexual identity. She constructs a vision of therapy that helps the client develop a sense of entitlement to satisfying and equal relationships outside the therapist's office. She proposes that clients need help finding their mother tongue&#x201d; and retelling their story in a language freed from the patriarchal notions that have shaped and limited their experience. Her vision of therapy considers the dilemmas faced by feminist therapists who must work within a mental health system that is inherently sexist and use its flawed or problematic tools for testing and treatment.This powerful vision of feminist therapy is grounded throughout with case examples that illustrate how a dialogue between therapist and client can be healing, subversive, and transformative all at once.</p><p>Laura S.

It carries with it the added benefit of being expertly performed by Terry Bregy. Both deal with a Shaker boy and his maturation on a Vermont farm in the 1920&#39;s. Especially stressed are the boy&#39;s love for his family and the farm animals, as well as the importance of the land. While at times overly emphatic, Bregy delivers a fine performance, capturing well the New Hampshire/Vermont backwoods accent. His vocal characterizations are excellent, and the pacing is appropriate. An added treat is hearing creative regionalisms, such as &#34;a man so crooked he could hide behind a corkscrew.&#34; Especially inspiring and instructive for young adults, Bregy&#39;s interpretation underscores the goodness of Shaker ways.

The end of the sixteenth century was marked by the Inquisition and Counter-Reformation, a background of ideological war against which, despite all odds, brilliant feats of art and science were achieved. No artist captured the dark, violent spirit of the time better than Caravaggio, variously known as Marisi, Moriggia, Merigi, and sometimes, simply M. As art critic Robert Hughes has said, "There was art before him and art after him, and they were not the same." Robb's masterful biography "re-creates the mirror Cravaggio held up to nature," as Hilary Spurling wrote in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, "with singular delicacy as well as passion and panache."</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Robb</b> was born in Australia and has lived in Naples and southern Italy for most of the past two decades. His first book, <i>Midnight in Sicily</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and a New York Public Library Book of the Year.</p>Recognized now as a peer of 17th-century masters Rembrandt and Vermeer, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610) painted notoriously provocative religious and classical tableaux, yet left few traces ("no letters, no table talk, no notebook or treatise") of his life beyond his art. Australian -born Robb, whose ex-pat tour-de-force Midnight in Sicily: On Art, Food, History, Travel, &amp; La Cosa Nostra took readers through that fascinating island, has created an idiosyncratic but dazzling biography of Caravaggio by exploiting almost every extant fragment, including a handful of sightings by friends and enemies, and the scanty Italian police files. More audaciously, Robb spreads through the life many pages on every known canvas, leaving appropriately theatrical description in his wake. Robb's Caravaggio--or "M," as he insists on calling the multimonikered and aliased painter--was a violent man of "hairtrigger touchiness," who fueled the passionate intensity of his painting with his professional and emotional frustrations, managing to register raw life in a religious culture that demanded, according to Robb, vapid holiness. Bisexual, he painted and loved pubescent boys, and patronized the female prostitutes he used as models. To great effect, Robb inserts reflections by the painter's contemporaries within his own sentences, offsetting them with italics rather than quotation marks: "M's repeated and humiliating requests for small advances from Masetti confirmed the need. That wasn't his style and he reddens whenever he sees me." He studs his own descriptions with odd words, obscenities and anachronistic, out-of-place contemporary references ("... like Ronald Reagan playing the cowboy"). Yet it all works--Robb's flawed, melodramatic, swollen biography is crammed with more about the dark, driven Caravaggio than any previous life. Just as Caravaggio took art to the edge, Robb takes biography there. 16 pages of illus., 8 in color, not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gather Together in My Name</h2><p>In <i>Gather Together in My Name</i> Maya Angelou continues her stunning autobiography.

From Plato&#x2019;s critique of the Sophists in Protagoras to John Henry Newman&#x2019;s considerations of education in The Idea of a University in 1854, from the educational projects of Maria Montessori, Rudolf Steiner, and Loris Malaguzzi in the 20th century to Kieran Egan&#x2019;s call for a reimagination of education in the 21st, educators and philosophers have regularly turned to two fundamental questions: &#x201c;What is the purpose of an education?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How is it to be achieved?&#x201d; This is the essence of Friedrich Schiller&#x2019;s letters On the Aesthetic Education of Man. For Schiller, the salvation of education--and of man--lies in the realization of Beauty. Only Beauty, in his thought, has the ability to ennoble both thinking and sentiment, and only Beauty can allow the human person to awaken what he calls the &#x201c;play impulse,&#x201d; which manifests itself as &#x201c;the extinction of time in time and the reconciliation of becoming and absolute being, of variation with identity&#x201d; (Fourteenth Letter). Play is important to Schiller because play returns the human person to himself: &#x201c;For, to declare once and for all, Man plays only when he is in the full sense of the word a man, and he is only wholly Man when he is playing&#x201d; (Fifteenth Letter). It is important in times such as ours that we turn to philosophies of education that emphasize not the utilitarian desires of governments and corporations but the simultaneously transcendent and immanent qualities that reveal to us what it is to be human. Friedrich Schiller&#x2019;s letters On the Aesthetic Education of Man is such a text. Schiller does not provide us with a pedagogical strategy, nor does he offer us a definitive answer as to what such an aesthetic education would look like. But he does indicate where we should seek the right kinds of questions. (From the Foreword.)</p><p>Michael Martin is professor of philosophy emeritus at Boston University.

Their paintings of the wilderness are unmistakable and evoke the same response in viewers today as they did when first exhibited 80 years ago. </p><p> <b>The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson</b>, which includes many never-before-reproduced paintings, presents the most complete and extensive collection of their works ever published. Containing 400 paintings and drawings, it reveals the talent and genius of all eleven painters who, at one time or another, were part of the movement:</p><ul> <li></li>Frank Carmichael <li></li>Frank Johnston <li></li>A.J. Casson <li></li>Arthur Lismer <li></li>LeMoine FitzGerald <li></li>J.E.H. MacDonald <li></li>Lawren Harris <li></li>Tom Thomson <li></li>Edwin Holgate <li></li>F.H. Varley <li></li>A.Y.

Introductory essays explain the works and provide a context for greater understanding and appreciation. </p></p><p><p> In Canada, everyone grew up with and loved reproductions of paintings by the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson. These painters (all eleven of them!) defined the way Canadians saw their country. </p><p> The Group was formed in 1920 and exhibited together only eight times from 1920 to 1931 before they disbanded in 1933. One member dropped out right after the first exhibition; another was added in 1926, another in 1929, and yet another in 1932, but the name, with delightful illogic, remained unchanged. 'The Group had no formal organization,' A.Y. Jackson wrote later, 'and since we had no money we had no need of a treasurer.' They never painted together as a group, and indeed on only two occasions did even four of them paint together. Their main focal points in Toronto were their studios and the Arts and Letters Club, where they regularly had lunch together. </p><p> You would think that such an important art movement, which determined the course of Canadian painting for decades, would have many publications to honour and display their work. But, until now, there has not been a single volume in which a generous selection of work by each member could be seen. Out of 369 colour plates, nearly a third are reproduced here for the first time. They show the wide range of subjects that attracted the Group: landscapes from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic oceans, cities, towns, villages, and farms, people, flowers, and the turmoil of the First World War. This is as large a compendium of these magnificent works as is likely to be published in our time. </p><p> <b>David P.

In these four stories, Stefan Zweig shows his gift for the acute analysis of emotional dilemmas. His four tragic and moving cameos of the human condition are played out against cosmopolitan and colonial backgrounds in the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p>Stefan Zweig was born in 1881 into a wealthy Viennese Jewish family.

Zweig traveled widely, living in Salzburg, London and New York before settling in Brazil where he and his wife were found dead in 1942.&#x201c;What did Zweig have that brought him the fanatical devotion of millions of readers, the admiration of Herman Hesse, the invitation to give the eulogy at the funeral of Sigmund Freud? To learn that, we would have to have a biography that illuminated <i>all</i> aspects of his work, that read <i>all</i> of his books, and that challenged, rather than accepted, the apparent modesty of his statements about his life and work.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Benjamin Moser, <i>Bookforum</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Amok</i>, a 1922 novella (recently reissued in Pushkin Press&#x2019;s <i>Collected Stories</i>, translated by Anthea Bell). . . is quintessentially Zweig, masterful in generating suspense, operatically predictable (the woman always dies in Act Four, so the man has a story to tell in Act Five), and drenched in the implicit mores of the day, which Zweig tweaked in his modest fashion by depicting a clean abortion as a better option than a coat hanger. . . . <i>Amok</i> is a compelling story: for its meticulous portrait of the doctor&#x2019;s emotional process, its compression, and the almost identically sharp observations of gestures, movements, the charged silences in a conversation.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013; Gary Indiana, <i>Bookforum</i></b><br>"I can&#x2019;t think of a writer who is more successful at depicting amour fou - what one critic describes as 'sex and madness breaking through the lacquered screen of upper-bourgeois society'- nowhere more grippingly than in Amok in which a doctor, a Conradesque loner, is tipped into "a sort of human rabies" by an unattainable colonial wife."&nbsp;<b>&#x2013;&nbsp;Julie Kavanagh, <i>The Economist</i> <i>Intelligent Life</i></b><br><br>"To read Zweig is to be in the presence of a properly mature writer, for all that his characters are often in the grip of highly inappropriate desires.

Winner of the Edgar Award. Reissue.</p><p>Nobody writes better than Jan Burke about the real world of print journalism, and that aspect of her latest Irene Kelly mystery is as strong as ever. The tensions of being the wife of a cop and continuing to work as a crime reporter in the Southern California desert city of Las Piernas have increased with each big story Irene covers: it's almost as though her associates are waiting for her to make some mistake, to fumble a story. When an edgy, rebellious teenage girl asks her to look for her missing mother, Irene crosses the path of a very dangerous serial killer--Nicholas Parrish. He is one of those totally anonymous but enormously gifted and resourceful villains found only in fiction. Parrish kills women who happen to look like Irene (and his abusive mother), and attracts devoted disciples to his grisly cause. Because of Irene's involvement, several more lives are damaged or endangered, and the strain takes its toll on the reporter's mental stability.<p> Burke is such a fine, realistic writer that she can tread her way carefully across territory already well covered by Patricia Cornwell, Jeffery Deaver, Thomas Harris, et al. and still find something new to say about ritual murder and forensic science. But her real talent is bringing to full, instant life a remarkable woman--and the city she lives and works in. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Jan Burke is the author of a dozen novels and a collection of short stories.

EvenHe stated that that Aradia, or The Gospel of the Witches, as I have given it, is in reality only the initial chapter of the collection of ceremonies, `cantrips,&#39; incantations, and traditions current in the fraternity or sisterhood, the whole of which are in the main to be found in my Etruscan Roman Remains.

He lives in Dublin.<b>1981</b><br>&nbsp;<br>MY MOTHER AND FATHER did not have a happy marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>Years have passed since I last endured their company, decades, but they pass through my thoughts almost every day for a few moments, no longer than that. A whisper of memory, as light as Zoya&#x2019;s breath upon my neck as she sleeps by my side at night. As gentle as her lips against my cheek when she kisses me in the first light of morning. I cannot say when they died exactly. I know nothing of their passing other than the natural certainty that they are no longer of this world. But I think of them. I think of them still.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have always imagined my father, Daniil Vladyavich, dying first. He was already in his early thirties by the time I was born and from what I can recall of him, he was never blessed with good health. I have memories of waking as an infant in our small timber-framed <i>izba </i>in Kashin, in the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, pressing my hands to my tiny ears to repel the sound of his mortality as he choked and coughed and spat his phlegm into the fire burning in our small stove. I think now that he may have had a problem with his lungs. Emphysema, perhaps. It&#x2019;s difficult to know. There were no doctors to administer to him. No medicines. Nor did he bear his many illnesses with fortitude or grace. When he suffered, we suffered too.<br>&nbsp;<br>His forehead extended in a grotesque fashion from his head, I remember that also. A great mass of misshapen membrane protruding with smaller distensions on either side of it, the skin stretched taut from hairline to the bridge of his nose, pulling his eyebrows north to give him an expression of permanent disquiet. My older sister, Liska, told me once that it was an accident of birth, an incompetent doctor taking hold of the cranium rather than the shoulders as he emerged into the world, pressing too hard on the soft, not yet solidified bone beneath. Or a lazy midwife, perhaps, careless with another woman&#x2019;s child. His mother did not live to see the creature she had produced, the deformed baby with his misshapen skull. The experience of giving my father life cost my grandmother her own. This was not unusual then and rarely a cause for grief; it was seen as a balance of nature. Today, it would be unexpected and worthy of litigation. My grandfather took another woman soon after, of course, to rear his young. <br>&nbsp;<br>When I was a boy, the other children in our village took fright when they saw my father walking along the road towards them, his eyes darting back and forth as he returned home from his farm labours, perhaps, or shaking his fist as he stepped out of a neighbour&#x2019;s hut after another argument over roubles owed or insults perceived. They had names for him and it excited them to shout these in his direction &#x2013; they called him Cerberus, after the threeheaded hound of Hades, and mocked him by pulling off their <i>kolpak</i>s and pressing their wrists to their foreheads, flapping them maniacally while chanting their war cries. They feared no retribution for behaving like this in front of me, his only son. I was small then and weak. They were not afraid of me. They pulled faces behind his back and spat on the ground in imitation of his habits, and when he turned to cry out like a wounded animal they would scatter, like grain seeds tossed across a field, disappearing into the landscape just as easily. They laughed at him; they thought him terrifying, monstrous and abhorrent all at once.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unlike them, I was afraid of my father, for he was liberal with his fists and unrepentant of his violence.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have no reason to imagine it so, but I picture him returning home some evening shortly after I made my escape from the railway carriage in Pskov on that cold March morning and being set upon by Bolsheviks in retaliation for what I had done. I see myself rushing across the tracks and disappearing into the forest beyond in fear of my life, while he shuffles along the road for home, coughing, hacking and spitting, unaware that his own is in mortal danger. In my arrogance, I imagine that my disappearance brought great shame upon my family and our small hamlet, a dishonour that demanded retribution. I picture a crowd of young men from the village &#x2013; in my dreams there are four of them; they are big and ugly and brutal &#x2013; bearing down upon him with cudgels, dragging him from the street towards the darkness of a high-walled lane in order to murder him without witness. I do not hear him crying out for mercy, that would not have been his way. I see blood on the stones where he lies. I glimpse a hand moving slowly, trembling, the fingers in spasm. And then lying still.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I think of my mother, Yulia Vladimirovna, I imagine her being called home to God in her own bed a few years later, hungry, exhausted, with my sisters keening by her side. I cannot imagine what hardships she must have faced after my father&#x2019;s death and I do not like to think of it, for despite the fact that she was a cold woman and betrayed her disappointment in me at every juncture of my childhood, she was my mother nevertheless and such a person is holy. I picture my eldest sister, Asya, placing a small portrait of me in her hands as she clasps them together for the final time in prayer, preparing in solemn penitence to meet her maker. The shroud is gathered to her thin neck, her face is white, her lips a pale shade of periwinkle blue. Asya loved me but envied my escape, I remember that too. She came to find me once and I turned her away. It shames me now to think of this.<br>&nbsp;<br>None of this may have happened, of course. The lives of my mother, my father and my sisters may have ended differently: happily, tragically, together, apart, in peace, in violence, there is no way for me to know. There was never a moment when I could have returned, never a chance that I could have written to Asya or Liska or even Talya, who might not have remembered her older brother, Georgy, her family&#x2019;s hero and shame. To return to them would have put them in danger, put me in danger, put Zoya in danger.<br>&nbsp;<br>But no matter how many years have passed, I think of them still. There are great stretches of my life that are a mystery to me, decades of work and family, struggle, betrayal, loss and disappointment that have blended together and are almost impossible to separate, but moments from those years, those early years, linger and resonate in my memory. And if they remain as shadows along the dark corridors of my ageing mind, then they are all the more vivid and remarkable for the fact that they can never be forgotten. Even if, soon, I shall be.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It has been more than sixty years since I last laid eyes on any member of my blood family. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to believe that I have lived to this age, eighty-two, and spent such a small proportion of my given time among them. I was remiss in my duties towards them, although I did not see it like that at the time. For I could no more have changed my destiny than altered the colour of my eyes. Circumstances led me from one moment to the next, and the next, and the next, as it does with any man, and I followed each step without question.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then one day I stopped. And I was old. And they were gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Do their bodies remain in a state of decomposition, I wonder, or have they already dissolved and become one with the dust? Does the act of putrefaction take several generations to complete or can it advance at a faster rate, dependent on the age of the body or the conditions of burial? And the speed of corporeal decay, does that depend on the quality of the wood from which one&#x2019;s coffin is made? The appetite of the soil? The climate? In the past, these are the types of questions that I might have pondered over while distracted from my night-time reading. Typically, I would have made a note of my query and researched it until a satisfactory answer had been arrived at, but my routines have all fallen apart this year and such investigations seem trivial to me now. Indeed, I have not been to the library for many months, not since before Zoya became ill. I may never go there again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of my life &#x2013; most of my adult life, that is &#x2013; has been spent within the tranquil walls of the library at the British Museum. I began my employment there in the early autumn of 1923, shortly after Zoya and I first arrived in London, cold, fearful, certain that we might yet be discovered. I was twenty-four years old at the time and had never known that employment could be so peaceful. It had been five years since I had shed the symbols of my previous life &#x2013; uniforms, rifles, bombs, explosions &#x2013; but I remained branded by their memory. Now it was soft cotton suits, filing cabinets and erudition, a welcome change.<br>&nbsp;<br>And before London, of course, was Paris, where I developed that interest in books and literature that had first begun in the Blue Library, a curiosity that I hoped to pursue in England. To my eternal good fortune, I noticed an advertisement in <i>The Times </i>for a junior librarian in the British Museum and I applied in person later that day, hat in hand, and was immediately taken in to meet a Mr Arthur Trevors, my potential new employer.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can remember the date exactly. August the twelfth. I had just come from the Cathedral of the Dormition and All Saints where I had lit a candle for an old friend, an annual gesture of respect to mark his birthday. <i>For as long as I live</i>, I had promised him all those years ago. It seemed appropriate, somehow, that my new life was to commence on the same day that his own short life had begun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you know how long the British Library has existed, Mr Jachmenev?&#x2019; he asked me, peering over the top of a pair of half-moon spectacles, which were perched uselessly towards the base of his nose. He didn&#x2019;t struggle even slightly with my name, which impressed me since so many English people seemed to make a virtue out of being unable to pronounce it. &#x2018;Since 1753...</p><h2>Edgar Lee Masters&#39; Spoon River Anthology</h2><p><p>Charles Aidman, conceived from Edgar Lee Masters' <em>Spoon River Anthology</em></p><p>Dramatic Platform Readings w/incidental music, songs </p><p></p><p>Characters: 3 male, 2 female</p>Bare Stage.<p>Via musical interludes, we are introduced in a cemetery to the ghosts of those who were inhabitants of this town, and whose secrets have gone with them to the grave.

Controversy has always surrounded the mysterious megastar, so when Bennis Hannaford, bestselling author and distant cousin of Tasheba's lover, is invited to the soiree, she gladly invites her best friend, former FBI agent Gregor Demarkian. <br><br>Death, it seems, requires no invitation to the festivities, for before Tasheba can blow out her candles, a crack on the skull cheats her of her centenary. The fete grows ever grimmer as Gregor investigates slashed telephone wires, suspicious revelers, and a second body among the birthday balloons. When a mammoth storm blows up, trapping them all on the island, only Demarkian can stop a killer whose dearest wish is to kill again.</p><p>Described in the story as "Philadelphia's own Armenian-American Hercule Poirot," Gregor Demarkian tags along with his friend, fantasy novelist Bennis Hannaford, when she attends a distant relative's disastrous 100th birthday party. Tasheba Kent, once a silent screen star, caused a scandal in the 1930s when she ran off with her equally famous brother-in-law, Cavender Marsh, after her sister's mysterious death in France. The couple ensconced themselves in a gloomy mansion on an island off the coast of Maine and became recluses. For her birthday, however, they plan to auction off some of their possessions, an event drawing a motley assemblage of interested folk, including Cavender's daughter, whom he abandoned as an infant; a collector of Tasheba's memorabilia; a tabloid journalist; and an assortment of bankers and lawyers. When, during a fierce storm, Tasheba and the journalist are murdered, Gregor must call on his investigative skills, honed during his service with the FBI, and prevent another murder while he unmasks the killer. In this 10th in her holiday series after Bleeding Hearts, Haddam colors a transparent mystery plot with the traditions of gothic horror tales and silent film melodrama. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Haddam (Bleeding Hearts, 1994, etc.) must be running out of holidays: This time her homicidal tendencies are released by a birthday. But what a birthday it is--Tasheba Kent's centenary, designed to kick off an auction of memorabilia from her silent- film career. What actually kicks off, of course, is Tasheba herself, whose inaccessible private island off the Maine coast is awash in dead telephones, recorded screams, telltale cufflinks and feather boas, as well as suspects who wonder whether Tasheba's longtime companion Cavender Marsh really killed his wife, Lilith Brayne, back in 1938 in order to spend the rest of his life with her sister. Detection honors go to ex-FBI agent Gregor Demarkian, who spends an awful long time working up to the obvious solution. Minor Haddam, this cheerfully brazen homage to Ten Little Indians still has all the sparkle and complexity her fans have come to expect. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But there, the British 8th Army loaded them into trucks, purportedly to take them to Italy, only to deliver them straight back to Tito's Partisans. The Partisans tortured and then executed them. The remaining civilians were spared due to the brave revolt of the British Red Cross and Quaker aid workers. John Corsellis witnessed and took part in these protests and in this book reconstructs the survivors' stories. These are vivid tales of wartime cruelty, of the revival of battered communities in refugee camps, and of emigration to Argentina, the U.S., Canada and Britain. In this unique volume, the authors call on more than half a century of research and an unsurpassed knowledge of the Slovene migrant communities around the world to tell their stories. <br></p><p>John Corsellis has published a series of articles on the Slovene refugees based on his post-war involvement with them.

Lyons</b> is the author of many books for children and young adults, including <i>Roy Makes a Car, Feed the Children First, Dear Ellen Bee, Letters from a Slave Girl</i>, and <i>Sorrow's Kitchen</i>. In addition to the Golden Kite Award and a <i>Horn Book</i> Fanfare for <i>Letters from a Slave Girl</i>, Lyons was also the recipient of a 2005 Aesop Award for <i>Roy Makes a Car</i> and a Carter G. Woodson Award for <i>Sorrow's Kitchen</i>. A teacher and former librarian, she lives in Charlottesville, Virginia. You can learn more about her at www.lyonsdenbooks.com.Grade 7 Up-- A succinct biography of the black novelist whose spirited use of dialect occasioned criticism from other prominent black writers, and who until recently was largely forgotten. Raised in Florida at the turn of the century , Hurston was indefatigable in her pursuit of self-improvement and an outlet for her acknowledged storytelling gift. Although it took many years, she put herself through Howard University, and then went on to Barnard for an advanced degree in anthropology. During these same years, her short stories made her an award-winning contributor to the literature of the Harlem Renaissance, from which she went on to write novels and compile collections of black folklore. Lyons is fond of her subject, and attempts to gild the lily--but Hurston, prickly as a cactus, refuses to gild. Her self-promotion, flamboyance, and inability to maintain stable relationships come through clearly. But so, thanks to the inclusion of generous passages from her various books, does her shining literary gift. While the cover does not grab, a 30-second booktalk using Hurston's traumatic family life or her experience with zombies in Haiti, a telling of one of her folktales, or a quick look at any of the excellent black-and-white photographs that grace the book will catch readers. Even on paper, whether it is in her words or her image, Hurston is a vibrant presence. Young adults who encounter her will come away enriched. A necessary enhancement for any collection that wants to present the depth and diversity of black history. --Ann Welton, University Child Development School, Seattle<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Father Christmas Letters</h2><p>A collection of illustrated letters from Father Christmas recapping the activities of the preceding year at the North Pole. The letters were written by the author to his children.</p><p>J.R.R. Tolkien (1892&#x2013;1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959.

So the time is right for a retelling of the story. This is a lively, accessible, inspirational version attractive both to adults and older children. It stays faithful to the spirit of the original while highlighting the relevance of its themes to current issues. The storyline is clarified and simplified. There is a brief introduction and a longer, reflective essay to examine the larger questions and themes the story raises. There is a strong practical element to help readers engaged in their own quest for meaning.</p><p>Acclaimed author Lindsay Clarke won the 1989 Whitbread Prize for Fiction with Chymical Wedding and is also well-known for Alice&#39;s Masque. He has an extensive knowledge of mythology and legend and runs workshops in the UK and abroad.The story line may be familiar, but Clarke does a solid job of bringing to life the world of the Arthurian legends in this retelling of Parzival's quest for the Holy Grail. The story opens with a brief account of the adventures of Parzival's father, a war-happy knight named Gahmuret who forsakes his new bride to go in search of conflict and glory, only to be killed in battle. From there, Clarke shifts to the son's tale, alternating accounts of Parzival's initial encounter with the Grail with the lusty meanderings of Gawain, a knight whose desire for romantic adventures is just as strong as his yearning for battle and recognition. Parzival's first encounter with the Grail throws his family into temporary disgrace and, when a witch curses him for his folly, he must go back and find the Grail a second time to square his accounts with the magic-oriented morality of the medieval world. Clarke, a scholar who provides a lengthy and thoughtful afterword to fill in the blanks for modern readers who are unfamiliar with Arthurian culture, certainly knows his material as well as his audience. But the nature of the story limits him to a wearisome alternation between battle scenes and love conquests, the one intriguing exception being Gawain's adventure in a house of horrors called Castle of Marvels that is controlled by an invisible evil magician named Kilgore. The craft and research that are obvious behind the writing will ensure Clark an audience among aficionados of medieval fiction, but there's nothing compelling enough in this particular retelling to earn him a wider audience. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Explorer&#39;s Eye: First-Hand Accounts of Adventure and Exploration</h2><p>Combining firsthand accounts with original images in vintage black and white and brilliant color, The Explorer&#39;s Eye, gives insights into who these men and women were, how they operated, and what they saw.

P. Lovecraft. In the ruins of an ancient stone house in Ireland is found the diary of an elderly man who lived alone with his sister and their pets, and who longed for his lost love. The diary tells of how the man explores a cyclopean cavern beneath the house and fights off swarms of white pig-like monsters pouring up from below. Then, in a visionary sequence, he breaks through to an alternate space-time dimension and sees a doppelganger of his house on a vast desolate plain. The prose is hokey at times, but the strange mood evoked by the other-dimensional setting is powerful indeed. As acclaimed horror writer T. E. D. Klein says, &#34;Never has a book so hauntingly conveyed a sense of terrible loneliness and isolation.&#34;William Hope Hodgson (15 November 1877 &#x2013; April 1918) was an English author. He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction and science fiction. He used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the "Sargasso Sea Stories". His novels such as The Night Land and The House on the Borderland feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. Early in his writing career he dedicated effort to poetry, although few of his poems were published during his lifetime. He died in World War I at the age of 40.</p><h2>Peep inside animal homes</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>&#39;Like all Usborne books, it is beautifully illustrated... another fab offering from Usborne!&#39; - Activities 4 Kidz; &#39;Written in straightforward prose which will intrigue and inform, the book opens up a wonderful hidden world of animal homes...

Suspects included his secretary Edward Sands, a thief and forger; Henry Peavey, his homosexual black cook; and two flamboyant screen stars: drug-addicted Mabel Normand, whom he loved; and 20-year-old Mary Miles Minter, who yearned to be his mistress. In a meticulous probe that reads like a detective thriller, editor-publisher Giroux ( The Book Known as Q ) makes a strong case that the murderer was a contract killer. He shows that Normand had incurred the wrath of dope peddlers, as did Taylor when he attempted to help her break her addiction. Brimming with details of Hollywood's silent era and its rampant post-WW I drug culture, this procedural offers glimpses of Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Sam Goldwyn, Mack Sennett, Fatty Arbuckle.

Kirkpatrick's best-selling A Cast of Killers ( LJ 7/86). Strangely enough, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux publisher Giroux doesn't mention A Cast of Killers in this book on the case, although he obviously disagrees with its conclusion (that a starlet's mother killed Taylor) and its negative portrait of Taylor. While Giroux fails to provide readers with a solution to the crime, movie buffs will nevertheless appreciate his additional background history on the case and his admirable downplay of the scandals of the silent film era. --Susan Caputo, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Structural Fabulation</h2><p>1975 University of Notre Dame Press</p><p></p><h2>Seeing and Believing: How the Telescope Opened Our Eyes and Minds to the Heavens</h2><p>An entertaining, concise look at the impact of the advent of the telescope on the way humans view the universe and their place in it focuses on the visionaries, beginning with Galileo, who created and perfected it. 25,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Journalist Richard Panek begins his historical essay on the telescope with the Hubble Deep Field. This extended exposure by space telescope is a picture that looks out of our galaxy--farther, immeasurably farther, than the human eye has seen before. It exemplifies the purpose of all telescopes: "To address our place in the universe, literally. To size up all of space and figure out where we are in it." How and why did this particular technology have such profound effects?<p> Panek first considers Galileo, who "raised his new instrument toward the night sky and understood at once that there was more to see--and more to seeing--than meets the eye.... Unlike spectacles or magnifying lenses, the optic tube offered not just a distortion of what was already there, but <i>more</i>. It revealed evidence that was different from what the naked eye could see, evidence that <i>wasn't otherwise there.</i>" Panek goes on to look at the, ahem, luminaries of observational astronomy--William Herschel, George Ellery Hale, Edwin Hubble--showing how faith in the telescope grew and our mental image of the universe expanded until "all the assumptions safely based on observation are gone." Panek's prose is vivid and beautiful, sustaining this (curiously) unillustrated book as it traces the astronomer's quest for light and dark, sight and belief. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Richard Panek has written about astronomy and science for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Natural History</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and <i>Outside</i>.

An empty refrigerator dooms the cook to a tiresome trip to the store, the agony of starting from scratch for each meal, or worse: night after night of soulless, expensive take-out. But with a little planning ahead, a hearty weekend meal can provide several delicious meals throughout the week. In <i>Cooking for the Week</i>, weekend dinners are designed to provide plenty of leftovers, which are then used in clever weekday recipes. And these weekday meals are no dried-out rehash: leftovers are creatively transformed into stir-fries, salads, soups, pastas, fajitas, sandwiches, and other delectable reincarnations. Each weekend menu is tied to three or four weekday dishes, so planning a week&#x2019;s worth of family meals is easier than anyone ever imagined. <i>Cooking for the Week</i> gives you a plan that makes it possible to eat well, feed the family, and spend weekday evenings relaxing instead of running around. Now that&#x2019;s a great idea!</p><p>Kathleen Taggart along with Dan Taggart, and Diane Morgan, authors of The Basic Gourmet, met while teaching at a Pacific Northwest culinary school. Their book Entertaining People won an IACP award. All three live and work in the Portland area.Leftovers by any other name can still taste as good, if not better. In this book, the culinary team of Morgan, Taggart and TaggartAcoauthors of the IACP Award-winning Entertaining People and The Basic GourmetAmap out a week's worth of meals (including sides and desserts) that busy cooks can make ahead of time during the weekend. Of course, the basics are covered: for example, instructions to roast two chickens instead of one are followed by recipes for Biscuit-Topped Chicken Pie and Asian Chicken Salad with Green Onion-Sesame Dressing. Once the creative juices get flowing, the leftover offerings are more tempting than the original dishes, such as for Thursday night's Risotto with Salmon, Parsley and Green Onions, made from Sunday night's Whole Roast Salmon. Illustrated with tantalizing photographs, the book also offers hints on stocking the pantry and storing leftover food. Perhaps the most impractical piece of advice, however, is making the Chocolate Cheesecake during the weekendAand expecting it to last through the entire week.

Perhaps the most horrible and ugly monster in the world. . . .</i><br><br>So ugly is the monster that he can turn a blue sky to snow and evaporate a pond just by dipping his toe in it. No living thing can stand to be in his presence. But the monster is not ugly on the inside; he&#x2019;s just lonely.

He is the author-illustrator of the Blue Rabbit books and <i>The Animal Train</i>. The author lives in England.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;The premise of this story is a bit troubling. The omniscient narrator tells readers that once there was a big monster that lived in a cave. He was so ugly that birds and animals fled, the grass withered, and the trees shed their leaves in his presence. His supreme ugliness left him with only the rocks for company. This much-misunderstood, lonely creature began to craft animals out of stone, but they cracked to pieces when he smiled upon them. That is, all except a small stone rabbit that for some unknown reason survived and kept the monster company into his dotage. The rabbit keeps a silent vigil even after the monster's death and remains as his former environs morph into "perhaps the most beautiful place in the whole world." The fact that the monster is such a pitiable, benign character who is cruelly isolated due to his perceived ugliness is very sad indeed. His home's rebirth into lush splendor only after his death strikes an additionally tragic note. This tale may cause children to reflect on the unfairness of judging and rejecting others based on their physical attributes, but the lack of a positive resolution during the monster's lifetime also sends a somewhat hopeless message. The color illustrations portray a rather engagingly hideous creature with hidden charms and depths. So much so that children may be left to wonder what all the fuss was about regarding the monster's ugliness.<i>&#x2013;Rosalyn Pierini, San Luis Obispo City-County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At its heart, it is the diary of a girl named Rywka Lipszyc who detailed the brutal conditions that Jews in the Lodz ghetto, the second largest in Poland, endured under the Nazis: poverty, hunger and malnutrition, religious oppression, and, in Rywka&#x2019;s case, the death of her parents and siblings. Handwritten in a school notebook between October 1943 and April 1944, the diary ends literally in mid-sentence. What became of Rywka is a mystery. A Red Army doctor found her notebook in Auschwitz after its liberation in 1945 and took it back with her to the Soviet Union.</p><p><em>Rywka&#x2019;s Diary</em> is also a moving coming-of-age story, in which a young woman expresses her curiosity about the world and her place in it and reflects on her relationship with God&#x2014;a remarkable affirmation of her commitment to Judaism and her faith in humanity. Interwoven into this carefully translated diary are photographs, news clippings, maps, and commentary from Holocaust scholars and the girl&#x2019;s surviving relatives, which provide an in-depth picture of both the conditions of Rywka's life and the mysterious end to her diary.</p><p>Moving and illuminating, told by a brave young girl whose strong and charismatic voice speaks for millions, <em>Rywka&#x2019;s Diary</em> is an extraordinary addition to the history of the Holocaust and World War II.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Anita Friedman leads Jewish Family and Children's Services (JFCS) of the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the largest and oldest family service institutions in the United States.

Johnson (History/Univ. of Colorado) argues that the commonly held view of the gold rush leaves out many of its principal actors; derived in large part from the chummy, mud-spattered writings of Bret Harte, that view centers on Anglo-American miners while elbowing thousands of Eastern-European, South-American, African-American, Mexican, and Chinese workers into the backgroundto say nothing of the Native Americans on whose territory the gold rush took place. Johnson looks beyond Hartes tales of camaraderie to depict the California gold camps as hotbeds of ethnic and cultural strife, battlegrounds on which Anglo- Americans not only sought their personal fortunes but asserted political dominion over the region, newly conquered from Mexico, a task that made them anxious about issues of gender, of race and culture, and of class. Their attempts to impose this control, Johnson suggests, were often misguided. A monthly $20 tax on foreign (that is, non-Anglo) miners, for instance, drove away much-needed cooks, haulers, and common laborers, and it was soon done away with. Johnson turns up useful correctivesfor one, that most Chinese workers came to California freely, rather than as indentured laborersand gives needed attention to the Miwok and other Indian peoples who often fell afoul of the gold seekers, sometimes because of simple cultural misunderstandings. The more interesting threads of her argument, however, are buried in a surfeit of incidental detail, and her narrative too often becomes a mere recitation of undigested facts, betraying its origins as a doctoral dissertation. Published a shade too late to join the flood of books commemorating the 150th anniversary of the gold rush, Johnsons study makes a useful yet decidedly secondary reference for scholars and students of the period. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The time is the 15th century, when intrepid merchants became the new knighthood of Europe. Among them, none is bolder or more cunning than Nicholas vander Poele of Bruges, the good-natured dyer's apprentice who schemes and swashbuckles his way to the helm of a mercantile empire. <br>In 1461, Nicholas is in Florence. Backed by none other than Cosimo de' Medici, he will sail the Black Sea to Trebizond, last outpost of Byzantium, and the last jewel missing from the crown of the Ottoman Empire. But trouble lies ahead. Nicholas's stepdaughter--at the tender age of thirteen--has eloped with his rival in trade: a Machiavellian Genoese who races ahead of Nicholas, sowing disaster at every port. And time is of the essence: Trebizond may fall to the Turks at any moment. Crackling with wit, breathtakingly paced, The Spring of the Ram is a pyrotechnic blend of scholarship and narrative shimmering with the scents, sounds, colors, and combustible emotions of the 15th century."Always immaculate in her research, brilliant in character descriptions, [Dunnett's] is a style second to none." --The Washington Post Book World<br><br>"Like a literary Pieter Breughel, [Dunnett] reproduces history in all its grime and glory. . . .

Here, Robert Bieder surveys the wealth of imagery, myths, and stories that surrounds the bear. Beginning with the dawn bear, the small dog-sized ancestor of all bears who hails from 25 million years ago, Bieder embarks on a fascinating exploration of the evolutionary history of the bear family, from extinct species such as the cave bear and giant short-faced bear to the mere eight species that survive today.<br><i>Bear</i> draws on cultural material from around the world to examine the various legends and myths surrounding the bear, including ceremonies and taboos that govern the hunting, killing, and eating of bears. The book also looks at the role of bears in modern culture as the subjects of stories, songs, and films; as exhibited objects in circuses and zoos; and, perhaps most famously, as toys. Bieder also considers the precarious future of the bear as it is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching, global warming, and disease and discusses the impact of human behavior on bears and their environments. <br><br>Accompanied by numerous vibrant photographs and illustrations, and written in an engaging fashion, <i>Bear</i> is an appealing and informative volume for anyone who has curled up with Winnie-the-Pooh or marveled at this powerful king of the forest.</p><p>Robert E.

But "the Servant girl Annihilators" are also making it a city of fear. The first victim, a mulatto housekeeper, is torn from her bed and murdered. Six more women will die, including pretty blond Eula Phillips, who is bank clerk's Will Porter's lover. Over a decade later, living in New York as O. Henry, Will cannot escape his memories--or a blackmailer's merciless demands. Then a mysterious letter invites him back to Texas to follow the dark path of a sadistic killer and make a stunning discover as he is forced to confront the demons of his own tormented mind...<br></p><p>Austin, Texas, 1885. Manhattan, 1906. Twenty-year-old ghosts haunt Will Porter, a.k.a. famous writer O. Henry, who may have changed names and cities but hasn't outrun the memory of a series of murders that cast a chilling shadow over a sunny and bustling town. In <i>A Twist at the End</i>, Steven Saylor, author of the Roma Sub Rosa mystery series (<i>Rubicon</i>, <i>The House of the Vestals</i>, <i>A Murder on the Appian Way</i>, <i>The Venus Throw</i>), riffs on reality: brutal and sadistic, the "Servant Girl Annihilator" killed seven Austin women in 1885, but the murders were never solved. Saylor weaves together murder mystery and love story, historical exploration and fictional creation, combining careful research with artistic license to hazard a potential solution to the now-obscure mystery.<p> Will is summoned back to Austin by a mysterious stranger bearing a letter whose author claims to have discovered the perpetrator of the hideous crimes; Saylor cleverly frames the story as a series of flashbacks during Will's trip to Texas. The sense of the train moving both forward, west toward Austin, and backward, deep into the past, accelerates the story itself, creating a foreboding sense of portent. Will himself is an engaging protagonist: "He considered himself to be fairly well-rounded, for a self-educated fellow. He could throw a lariat, quote from <i>Idylls of the King</i>, and grow an exceedingly fine moustache. Despite this r�sum�, once in Austin he had encountered some difficulties in earning a livelihood." His youth and naivet� are compelling counterpoints to the gritty boisterousness of the capital city, which Saylor evokes with careful precision.</p><p> Saylor has a light touch with historical irony. All too often, writers wrestle unsuccessfully with the temptation to have their characters make claims that we know, with all the wisdom of hindsight, will be disproved. The trick is to do this without making readers feel they've been poked sharply in the ribs (Do you get it? Do you get it?), and Saylor exhibits the commendable talent of grounding his characters' thoughts and observations in their historical context; they never seem forced or sly.</p><p> Unfortunately, the urge toward verisimilitude carries its own risks. Too often, Saylor will weave an item of historical record into his narrative--the so-called Female Clerks bill, for example--then seem oddly compelled to dispose of it; he brusquely states its actual outcome and drops it forevermore. The reader has the impression of a file drawer sliding shut (perhaps the one labeled "Historical Atmosphere"). Such moments, though they testify to Saylor's familiarity with Texas history, rupture the flow of the narrative.</p><p> The opening of the novel is so successful--with its O. Henry-esque twist that leaves readers ruefully shaking their heads, realizing too late the author's trickery--that one expects great things from the conclusion. Sadly, Saylor falls short of his own inspiration; the d�nouement may be logical, but it certainly is neither startling nor ironic, and what, after all, is an O. Henry story without irony? <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>STEVEN SAYLOR is the author of the internationally popular Roma Sub Rosa mysteries, set in ancient Rome.

A man of strange contradictions - capable of cold, callous detachment but so affected by his job that he was often unable to speak before an execution - Berry was the last hangman able to write freely about his work. Through Berry's experiences, Stewart Evans takes us on a journey into the world of Victorian crime and punishment. <p>Berry was an ex-policeman who took a genuine interest in his 'victims' - even creating his own 'black museum'. Aiming to be both efficient and merciful he worked to a table of drops of his own creation. Unfortunately, this did not prevent a few horrific incidents. The most notable was the execution of Robert Goodale who was decapitated by the force of the drop. In contrast, in the famous case of John Lee, Berry was unable to open the gallows trap. After three attempts - during which the gallows trap worked perfectly when Lee was removed - Lee was reprieved.</p><p>During his eight years as hangman, Berry executed over 130 men and women - and even claimed to have hanged Jack the Ripper. He enjoyed publicity and toured the country talking of his experiences and showing lantern slides of grim prison scenes and executions. Yet in later life this contradictory character suffered from depression and became almost suicidal.</p><p><i>Executioner</i> is a biography which offers insight into the world of the public executioner. It will appeal to all those interested in crime and punishment in the Victorian era.</p></p><p>Stewart Evans is a leading crime historian, widely considered one of the Victorian era.

His first short stories, and many later ones, are published in his <i>Collected Stories</i>. <i>A Long and Happy Life</i> was published in 1962 and won the William Faulkner Award for a best first novel. <i>Kate Vaiden</i> was published in 1986 and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. <i>The Good Priest's Son</i> in 2005 was his fourteenth novel. Among his thirty-seven volumes are further collections of fiction, poetry, plays, essays, and translations. Price is a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and his work has been translated into seventeen languages.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda After graduating from Duke University, Reynolds Price sailed off to Oxford in 1955, where he spent three years as a Rhodes scholar. During this time he published his first short story and produced a B. Litt. thesis on John Milton's dramatic poem "Samson Agonistes." He then returned to Duke for a short-term appointment as a teacher of creative writing and literature. Fifty years later, Price is still there in Durham, but now as the very distinguished James B. Duke Professor of English and one of America's most revered men of letters. This engaging memoir, however, covers just six years in a young man's life, albeit a life that was unusually rich in friendships and youthful accomplishment. At Oxford, Price's teachers included such eminent scholars as the aristocratic David Cecil, who used to grow so excited in lectures that he would spray spittle on students in the front row; the formidable Helen Gardner, an authority on John Donne with a disturbingly flirtatious way of twiddling with the pendants she always wore; and Nevill Coghill, who had once been the teacher of W.H. Auden. During his holidays, Price also managed to meet some truly famous people: He recognized and spoke with the very young Brigitte Bardot, glimpsed philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre on the street and was given a curt bow, and actually exchanged grins with fat Nikita Khrushchev. Following a performance of "Titus Andronicus," Price was introduced to Vivien Leigh and a nearly naked Laurence Olivier in their dressing room. He attended a to-die-for performance of Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" conducted by Karl B�hm and sung by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Irmgard Seefried, Christa Ludwig and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. He even dined at the home of the great actor John Gielgud. Like so many provincial Americans before him, Price eagerly, relentlessly sucked up as much English and European culture as he could. Of course, he also fell in love. Twice. Much of this memoir recounts Price's intense friendship with a fellow undergraduate named Michael Jordan, a relationship that taught him "an enormous amount about affection, love, steadfastness, wit, and patience." That friendship continues to this day, though it has never had any physical component. On the other hand, late in his Oxford sojourn Price virtually seduced a somewhat reluctant older East European scholar he calls Matyas. Yet like many of the people Price cared about, Matyas was essentially bisexual and ultimately settled down with a wife and family. In general, Price is very low-key about what he prefers to call his "queerness." (He notes that a "queer" friend once said: "Please don't call me gay. If you need an adjective, call me morose.") While clearly dazzlingly handsome (as the cover photograph of "Ardent Spirits" shows), Price claims never to have been a "draw" for men or women. He's never felt comfortable in gay bars. In his fiction he nearly always writes about heterosexual love and family life, insisting that he just doesn't know enough about homosexual couples. Fundamentally, Price presents himself as a generous mentor to the young, a deeply loyal friend and a born teacher. Back at Duke, though, he discovers that he has absolutely nothing to teach one member of his very first writing class, a 16-year-old girl named Anne Tyler. His other early students include the now well-known poet and fiction writer Fred Chappell and the journalist and environmentalist Wallace Kaufman. Courteously, Price only hints at the jealousies and rivalries of Duke's English department, though he speaks frankly of mentor William Blackburn's eventual paranoia, and repeatedly makes clear his own current disdain for today's cult of theory and cultural studies. Surprisingly, he also questions the value of his own specialty, creative writing: "I never urge advanced writing-study on talented students. I'm more than convinced that the best writing of fiction, poetry, and drama is the result of intense independent work by a naturally gifted man or woman who finds the time . . . to deepen those skills in the act of probing further down into what will prove to be his or her best subject matter, matter to which only he or she has guided him or herself, not a teacher nor a group of workshop colleagues." Certainly, this was Price's own method. "Ardent Spirits" traces his own literary self-formation: a first story and essays published in Encounter (he reviewed Albert Camus and Iris Murdoch with "deplorable condescension"); encouragement from people like William Styron, Stephen Spender and the agent Diarmuid Russell (whose clients included Eudora Welty); and the gradual realization that what he thought was just another story was in fact his first novel, "A Long and Happy Life" (which won the William Faulkner Award in 1962). While much of "Ardent Spirits" feels agreeably conversational and digressive, Price's individual sentences and similes can be striking: "Their mutual devotion was clear as clean water"; a landlady's black tea was "strong enough to ream a radiator"; Bill Blackburn "could scarcely write a postcard." Still, some of these pages do seem to lack punch, mainly because Price scrupulously sticks to just what he can remember. One wishes that he'd kept a diary and recorded the exact words and witticisms of his brilliant teachers and friends. David Cecil, he does tell us, once warned him that the famously ugly and notoriously sharp-witted Cyril Connolly was "not as nice as he looks." Fortunately, Price does offer some typically winning vignettes of W.H. Auden, who was in residence at Oxford as professor of poetry: "I mentioned my love of Emily Dickinson; he nodded with no enthusiasm -- 'Very little-bitty at times, don't you feel?' . . . He asked for my favorite opera composer. I said Wagner; he grinned, shut his eyes in bliss, tilted his head back: . . . 'I long to direct a production of Tristan und Isolde with two large lesbians -- no man and woman could ever carry on so fervently about one another.' " When Auden finally left Oxford, the neat and tidy Price was given a glimpse of the poet's living quarters: "I looked round at two rooms in a state of disarray that I'd never before seen generated by any human being. And Wystan had only been in residence for two months. The desk, the floors, the tables, and every other surface were inches -- if not feet -- deep in abandoned books, magazines, clothing, galley proofs, dirty dishes, whatever. My face may have betrayed my literal shock; but Auden only gave a brisk wave above the chaos and said 'If you'd like to come back later and see if there's anything you want, by all means do.' " Does the fastidious Reynolds Price come back to rummage through the great poet's trash? You'll have to read the very enjoyable "Ardent Spirits" to find out. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

The vivid, colorful illustrations are vintage Rockwell, as is the use of animal characters. A table of contents shows things that go. . . : on the road, to work, in the country, in the house. Each section is a two-page spread with approximately a dozen pictures that depict appropriate "things." Rockwell's selections reveal her characteristic humor: both balloons and rockets are things that go in the air; balls, lawn mowers, and pogo sticks are things that go in the yard. Her illustrations also convey humor: a rabbit on snowshoes, a moose on cross-country skis. This is a book that children will look at over and over again, and one that will create many opportunities for discussion as small children recognize and add Things That Go to Rockwell's list.

Its a welcome display of the great playwright and poet (who was also, like Pirandello and Strindberg, a masterly writer of fiction) in several of his less celebrated roles: as sharp-eyed analyst of social and political life in Berlin between the World Wars (The Monster, The Job); mischievous historical revisionist (Socrates Wounded); and purveyor of commercial detective stories (A Question of Taste). A few stories (Four Men and a Poker Game, Safety First) adumbrate plays to come, and at least onethe unfinished Life Story of the Boxer Samson- Krner''suggests that this truly protean man of letters might well have become an important novelist as well. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The world outside an open window and the animals that live there. And, of course, a loving family and the sweet dreams that fills a child's sleepy head.<br> With a deep reverence for our planet and all who inhabit it, Leslie Staub offers a simple, tender, and gently humorous bedtime prayer that will find a lasting place in the hearts of children of any denomination.<br></p><p>Leslie Staub's paintings have been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States. In addition to her books for Harcourt, she has illustrated Lives: Poems About Famous Americans. She lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. <br>Ages 2-4. "Bless my window opened wide / Bless the creatures who live outside." With simple chant and bright oil paintings, a bedtime ecological prayer connects a child in his room with all the animal life on the planet: in the forest and the ocean, in ponds and on plains. Insects receive only grudging inclusion ("even the bugs . . . even the ones with really small brains"), but that may be to force the rhyme. The playful pictures in big circular frames show all kinds of creatures, from elephants and hyenas to dogs and birds ("trumpeters, yappers, crowers and yowlers"), which the boy knows are there as he curls up in bed with his cat in his cozy room. The chant is nondenominational, as much lullaby as blessing, and young children will enjoy identifying the animals, the sounds they make, the places they live, and the connections between us all through the night. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Skipp (<i>Mondo Zombie</i>) originally pitched the book as a movie idea&#x2014;think Stephen King's <i>Needful Things</i> meets <i>From Dusk to Dawn</i>&#x2014;but such a synopsis doesn't do justice to the author's depiction of the mutual parasitism of the dancers, who hate the patrons who degrade and exploit them, and the audience, trapped by loneliness, who despise the strippers for presenting an unattainable ideal of perfection. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Harrington : From the Walter O. Evans Collection of African-American Art</h2><p>It was none other than Langston Hughes who called Oliver Wendell Harrington America&#39;s greatest black cartoonist. Yet largely because he chose to live as an expatriate far from the American mainstream, he has been almost entirely overlooked by contemporary historians and scholars of African-American culture. Born in 1912 and a graduate of the Yale School of Fine Arts, he was a prolific contributor of humorous and editorial cartoons to the black press in the 1930s and 1940s, but he achieved fame for his creation of a cartoon panel called Dark Laughter, a satire of Harlem society and featuring Bootsie, a character in the tradition of the wise fool. Bootsie became widely known and loved wherever black newspapers appeared. For airing strong antiracist views Harrington was targeted during the McCarthy era, and in 1951 he was self-exiled in Paris. In 1961 he found himself trapped behind the Berlin Wall, but he chose to remain in East Germany. His powerful political cartoons were published in East German magazines and in the American Communist newspaper The Daily World. He became a favorite among students and intellectuals in the Eastern Bloc. In America he was mainly forgotten. Here, selected from the Walter O. Evans Collection of African-American Art, is an omnibus of Harrington&#39;s best cartoons from the past four decades. It highlights his exceptional talent, his potent impact with editorial comment and social criticism, and his deserving of acclaim in his native land.</p><p>An appreciative retrospective of the art created by the man Langston Hughes called America&#39;s greatest black cartoonist</p><h2>The Second Opinion: A Novel</h2><p><p>Struck down by a hit-and-run driver, one of the world's most respected doctors lies comatose in the ICU unit of Boston's Beaumont Clinic.

Ackbar made a study of Imperial tactics and<br>defenses while serving the grand moff. Rebel agents released him from<br>servitude during a failed attempt to assassinate Tarkin. Ackbar returned<br>to his homeworld and convinced the normally peaceful Mon Calamari to join<br>the Rebels, bringing a much-needed fleet of capital ships into the<br>Alliance arsenal.<br><br>Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, the newly ranked Commander Ackbar<br>proposed a plan for dealing with Imperial escort frigates.

His story is one of a constant search, a search that takes him from an ideal early childhood to a strict education in Italy that proved largely irrelevant to his future, and then to exile from Fascist Italy in America; from being a highly political aspiring artist to becoming a highly successful advertising director (he invented the famous "Never underestimate the power of a woman"&nbsp;&nbsp;campaign) and a powerful force in the world of graphics as the art director of Fortune magazine; from life in the affluent commuter world of Connecticut to a return to Italy and the life of an artist. After all this--a full life by any account--he finds yet another successful vocation as the author and illustrator of children's books that have sold millions of copies throughout the world.<br><br>Lionni tells his story--it encompasses his early romance and happy marriage, and his countless extraordinary friends and acquaintances--in the most elegant and persuasive prose, the kind of English that only a distinguished European can write. And since his story is also the story of a lifetime of creativity, throughout the book are examples, in color and black-and-white, of his remarkable body of work--painting, sculpture, ceramics, mosaics, photography, graphics, and, of course, illustration. This is an autobiography both of great intellectual and artistic sophistication and of large human appeal.</p><p>Ask different people who Leo Lionni is and you might get different answers: a children's book author, a graphic designer, a lecturer, teacher, art director--in short, a 20th century Renaissance man. Now the man, who is 87 years old and still hard at work, answers for himself in the autobiography <i>Between Worlds</i>. Readers who know Lionni's work will take pleasure in learning more about it; those who are only now coming to know of the man will find much to amaze and inspire them in the details of his life. Born in Amsterdam in 1910, Lionni developed an interest in art early. By the time he was 30 he had lived in at least five countries, learned four languages, and taught himself a great deal about art, architecture, music, and literature. <p> Throughout his life Lionni has had a happy knack for being in the right place at the right time. After fleeing the fascism rolling through Europe, he found himself an assistant art director at a Philadelphia advertising agency. There his talent and genius found an outlet in the ambitious "Great Ideas of Man" campaign, which put his name on the map and brought him into contact with some of the great artists of the day. He gathered friends and acquaintances of the caliber of Man Ray, Piet Mondrian, and Andy Warhol. Today Lionni lives on a farm in Tuscany and is hard at work on a series of fables for children. His first 87 years have been so remarkable, one can't help but wish he had another 87 ahead.</p>Leo Lionni is the author of three books for adults and thirty for children. His art has been shown in galleries around the world. Now in his mid-eighties, he lives in Radda in Chianti, Italy.</p><h2>The Almanac of Rural Living</h2><p>Individuals seeking a more natural and self-sufficient way of life are provided with descriptions of helpful innovations and cost-cutting country skills as well as information on topics ranging from wind and solar energy for the home to veterinary care and midwifery</p><p></p><h2>Discovering the Villages of France</h2><p>A re-release of an illustrated visitor&#39;s guide to the smaller regions of France profiles lesser-known villages of interest for both tourists and armchair travelers, in a reference that provides coverage of areas from Proven�e and Brittany to Haute-Savoie and Bordeaux.

In an era when the steam engine fueled an industrial revolution and train travel exploded people's experience of space and time, Caldecott was inspired by his surroundings to capture action, movement, and speed in a way that had never before been seen in children's picture books. Thoroughly researched and featuring extensive archival material and a treasure trove of previously unpublished drawings, including some from Caldecott's very last sketchbook, Leonard Marcus's luminous biography shows why Caldecott was indeed the father of the modern picture book and how his influence lives on in the books we love today.</p></p><p><p><b>Leonard S. Marcus</b> is one of the world's leading writers about children's books and the people who create them. His own award-winning books include <i>Listening for Madeleine: A Portrait of Madeleine L'Engle in Many Voices; Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom; Minders of Make Believe; </i>and <i>The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth.</i> He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p><p><b>Randolph Caldecott</b> (1846-1886) was a British artist and illustrator and the namesake of the Caldecott Medal. Although primarily known for highly influential children's book illustrations, he also lent his artistic skills to novels, travel writing, and humorous cartoons, as well as sculpture and paintings. Some of his best known illustrations appear in <i>The House That Jack Built</i>, <i>John Gilpin</i>, <i>The Three Jovial Huntsmen</i>, and <i>A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go</i>.</p>Gr 6 Up-Marcus has sifted through a variety of archival collections to find fresh material by and about the celebrated 19th-century British illustrator. Opening with an arresting self-portrait, the volume chronicles Caldecott's birth, rise in British social circles, travels, publications, marriage, and untimely death. The book is handsomely designed with a jacket bordered in the burnt sienna favored by Caldecott. Endpapers are decorated with cameos; thick, cream-colored paper lends richness. Marcus skillfully places his subject in historical context, weaving in such concepts as the impact of the advent of the train on the artist's energetic style and the influence of contemporaries (Turner, Whistler, Tenniel). He wonders, convincingly, if Caldecott had seen Muybridge's photographs proving that horses run with all four legs in the air-and if they inspired his depiction of John Gilpin's galloping horse that graces the Caldecott Medal. Art and quotations bolster the narrative, building the character of a complex man and ultimately detailing his contributions to picture-book design. The question of audience arises. With a trim size comparable to a portrait-style picture book, a page count of 64, and examples with clear child appeal, this is not pitched to academics. Yet, its scrupulous documentation, thorough back matter, and sophisticated language, e.g., "The epicenter of England's burgeoning textile industry, Manchester was a new kind of city," indicate it is also not for casual, child readers. It will be a delight for picture-book enthusiasts and a provocative introduction for those who want the backstory of the man behind the medal.-Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Having as itw genesis the first attempts in 1394 of Albert Namatjira to follow the example of European painters, notably the Victorian-born Rex Battarbee, the tradition of watercolour painting is still being maintained by the descendants of Albert and his contemporaries. <p> Twelve contributors -- anthropologists, historians, art critics and collectors -- review the history and stylistic development fo the Hermannsburg watercolourists since the Finke River Mission's establishment in 1877, against a background of upheaval in Western Aranda culture. They chronicle the changing critical attitudes to the watercolours and their fluctuating fortunes in the art market, and assess the present role of the paintings within contemporary Aboriginal society. </p><p> With its wealth of illustrations (many previously unpublished), biographical and bibliographical information, The Heritage of Namatjira, which as been prepared with the full cooperation of the Aboriginal artists and communities concerned, will remain as a lasting tribute to more than a century of Western Aranda art and tradition.</p></p><p></p><h2>REVOLUTIONARY LETTERS</h2><p>This edition is the new volume of di Prima&#39;s classic Revolutionary Letters.

But off the field, the fury that made Lawrence Taylor a Hall of Fame player put him on a runaway blitz to self-destruction.</p></blockquote><p><em>LT:: Over the Edge</em> is a smash-mouth memoir by one of the game's greatest players, an unsparing look at the giant of all Giants whose struggle with a cocaine habit was the only thing in his life he couldn't tackle with ease.</p><p>Raw and uncut, Taylor tells of his life from a small townin Virginia to becoming the most dominant defensive player of all time. Through a record ten straight All-Pro seasons, LT led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl victories, along the way revolutionizing the outside linebacker position. But the bright lights of Giants Stadium were nothing compared to the even brighter lights of New York City, where the King of the NFL held court all night long, fueled by booze, drugs, sex, and his own sense of invincibility.</p><p>Twice suspended from the league for substance abuse, Taylor walked away from the white lines of the football field to the far more alluring white lines of New York drug culture. Not one week after his retirement in 1993, he was on vacation and binging on coke. And so began an endless blur of years of all-nighters, prostitutes, and crippling paranoia that ended his marriage and very nearly cost him his life. But after several arrests, with the Hall of Fame beckoning, Lawrence Taylor finally stared down his toughest opponent -- himself -- entered rehab, and got clean. In 1999, in his first year of eligibility, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame -- the man who had raised hell on and off the field had lived through it all.</p><p>Filled with intimate and revealing stories from his teammates, coaches, family, and friends,<em> LT: Over the Edge</em> will forever change the way you look at the game of football and the indomitable Lawrence Taylor.</p></p><p><p> Lawrence Taylor now divides his time between Florida and New Jersey.</p><br><br><p>Steve Serby is a columnist for the <em>New York Post.</em></p>In this slapdash effort, former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor and a supporting cast of characters recall the football legend's career and personal struggle with drug addiction. On the field, Taylor was universally regarded as the greatest defensive football player in the game's history. His size, speed and ferocity led the Giants to two Super Bowl championships in 1986 and 1990, and earned Taylor an exalted place in NFL folklore, as well as in the record books and in the Football Hall of Fame. All this for a player, readers learn, who rarely worked out, practiced lazily and played many of his awe-inspiring games hungover. While he was succeeding on the field, off the field Taylor's life was out of control. He was addicted to cocaine and to a hard-partying lifestyle that eventually led to a divorce, numerous arrests, financial ruin and employment prospects that sunk as low as professional wrestling. Although billed as an autobiography, the book (written with New York Post columnist Serby) is more an oral history, interweaving Taylor's remembrances with those of former teammates, coaches, sports writers and friends. While there are some memorable anecdotes and a few intimate glimpses, there is surprisingly little new here for Taylor fans beyond the depressing details of his most recent travails. That's unfortunate-underneath it all, Taylor' is a truly rich, compelling story. He remains a larger-than-life personality, and one who made extraordinary football history in one of the NFL's most colorful eras. Still, in this, his second shot at autobiography (his first was LT: Living on the Edge in 1987), the true substance of Lawrence Taylor goes woefully unexamined.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The text concentrates on five crucial battles with the aim of illuminating the war as a whole: Crete, Midway, Falaise, Berlin and Okinawa.</p><p>The best one-volume treatment available, <i>The Second World War</i> by John Keegan is an outstanding synthesis of an enormous amount of material on "the largest single event in human history." The book proceeds chronologically through the war, but chapters appearing at appropriate moments focus on particular themes, such as war production, occupation, bombing, resistance, and espionage. Keegan's ability to translate the war's grand strategies is impressive, and the battle descriptions are superb. Generals obviously play a key role in this narrative, but ordinary soldiers also receive proper credit, as do the often-overlooked merchant marines whose heroic efforts to supply Great Britain made the Allied victory possible. Keegan, author of the landmark book <i>The Face of Battle</i>, is without doubt one of our greatest military historians, and here his analytical powers and skilled writing are on full display.John Keegan is the Defence Editor of the Daily Telegraph and Britain&#39;s foremost military historian. The Reith Lecturer in 1998, he is the author of many bestselling books including The Face of Battle, Six Armies in Normandy, Battle at Sea, The Second World War, A History of Warfare (awarded the Duff Cooper Prize), Warpaths, The Battle for History, The First World War, and most recently, Intelligence in War. For many years John Keegan was the Senior Lecturer in Military History at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he has been a Fellow of Princeton University and Delmas Distinguished Professor of History at Vassar. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received the OBE in the Gulf War honours list, and was knighted in the Millennium honours list in 1999. John Keegan died in August 2012.</p><h2>Essential articles for the study of Thomas More (The Essential articles series)</h2><p>it illustrates the loss to the king</p><p></p><h2>Stashbuster Knits: Tips, Tricks, and 21 Beautiful Projects for Using Your Favorite Leftover Yarn</h2><p>There&#x2019;s no such thing as too much yarn.<br> &nbsp;<br> As renowned knitwear designer Melissa Leapman knows all too well, every knitter has a stash of yarn that they just can&#x2019;t bear to part with: the one or two extra balls of yarn bought &#x201c;just in case,&#x201d; or the bits and pieces leftover from completed projects. <br><br> <i>Stashbuster Knits</i> gives you the absolute best way to use&#x2014;and enjoy&#x2014;your treasured yarn collection guilt free.

Justly celebrated for its authoritative scholarship and invaluable commentary, Arden guides you a richer understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare&#39;s plays. This edition of King Henry IV Part II provides, a clear and authoritative text, detailed notes and commentary on the same page as the text, a full introduction discussing the critical and historical background to the play and appendices presenting sources and relevant extracts.</p><p>A new approach to critical analysis is offered by this interpretation of the play as an exploitative sequel issued in response to the popularity of the First Part, which was itself a remake of an old, non-Shakespearean play.The stirring continuation of the themes begun in <i>Henry IV, Part One</i> again pits a rebellion within the State and that master of misrule, Falstaff, against the maturing of Prince Hal. Alternating scenes between bawdy tavern and regal court, between revelry and politics, Shakespeare probes at the sources, uses, and responsibilities of power as an old king dies and a young king must choose between a ruler's solemn duty and a merry but dissipated friend, Falstaff.

In this work, the shift in Australia's tropical northern cities is scrutinized, illustrating their transformation from diverse, thriving communities into scenes of racial strife over the course of the 19th century.<br></p><p><b>Henry Reynolds</b> is a professor of history and classics at the University of Tasmania.

Kilala dreams of finding "true love like the Disney princesses"&#x2014;Cinderella, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Snow White, Belle, Jasmine and the out-of-place mermaid, Ariel. Kilala's clumsiness and spunky nature make her unlikely to be chosen to wear her school's princess crown, but when her best friend is kidnapped after winning the contest, Kilala sets out with handsome stranger Rei (sent to find the rightful owner of a mystical tiara) to find her. A magical gate leads her to the princesses, starting with Snow White. The animation-inspired characters are faithful to their original models and beautifully drawn, but the style contrast can be a bit odd. Character interaction within the same panel is kept to a minimum to avoid the abrupt comparison. The little girls the brand name Disney Princesses was developed for will eat this up with a shovel. It's comfortable, easy to read, and hits their favorite fantasies hard: what if I were a princess? what if I were specially picked by the handsome prince? what if I got to meet the characters I love?

Now, in <i>Beneath the Bonfire,</i> he demonstrates his talent for portraying "a place and its people with such love that you'll find yourself falling for them, too" (Josh Weil, author of <i>The Great Glass Sea</i>).</p><p>Young couples gather to participate in an annual "chainsaw party," cutting down trees for firewood in anticipation of the winter. A group of men spend a weekend hunting for mushrooms in the wilderness where they grew up and where some still find themselves trapped. An aging environmentalist takes out his frustration and anger on a singular, unsuspecting target. One woman helps another get revenge against a man whose crime extends far beyond him to an entire community. Together, the ten stories in this dazzling, surprising collection evoke a landscape that will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has traveled the back roads and blue highways of America, and they completely capture the memorable characters who call it home.</p></p><p>Nickolas Butler was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His writings have appeared in <i>Narrative Magazine, Ploughshares, The Kenyon Review Online, The Progressive, The Christian Science Monitor,</i> and elsewhere. A bestseller in both the United States and France, his debut novel, <i>Shotgun Lovesongs,</i> received the Midwest Booksellers Choice Award, the Great Lakes Great Reads Award, and France's Prix Page/America. Butler graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison before attending the Iowa Writers' Workshop and currently lives in Wisconsin with his wife and their two children.<p>&#x201c;Nickolas Butler follows up his acclaimed debut novel, <i>Shotgun Lovesongs</i>, with this collection of well-made short stories set in the Midwest. ... Mr. Butler's characters could have emerged from vintage American rock songs, living on small hopes and banding together as best they can.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;The stories in<i> Beneath the Bonfire</i> pack a sincere, emotional punch. Nickolas Butler's territory might be the Midwest (which warms this particular reader's heart), but the losses--and hard-won gains are universal. This writer is the real deal.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Orner, author of Last Car over the Sagamore Bridge</i></p><p>&#x201c;I love these stories: they're quiet, careful.As glaciated as their own vistas. Butler's is a deft hand, who as in the title story, takes us beneath the ice and forces us to confront the deepest extents of our friendships, our marriages, our family.Without a doubt, <i>Beneath the Bonfire </i>is a diamond of a collection, shaped and hardened through the profound geologic pressures of love and pain.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bill Cheng, author of Southern Cross the Dog</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Beneath the Bonfire</i> burns with nostalgia for those youthful years when we know too little and surrenders to the later years when we've learned too much. With honesty and tenderness, Butler portrays people at crossroads, as hardened and hopeful as the landscape they can't leave behind.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Diane Cook, author of Man V. Nature</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nickolas Butler's characters lust and cherish and sustain and betray and redeem and console, traveling through every chamber of the human heart, and it's hard to say--based on these excellent stories whether love is the easiest or the most complicated emotion, but it's clearly the best.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Benjamin Percy, author of The Dead Lands, Red Moon, and The Wilding</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sentence-by-sentence, <i>Beneath the Bonfire</i> is a truly beautiful collection that offers full and big-hearted tales of people leaning on one another when the world turns on them. It's a love letter to a landscape, yes, but it's also elegiac, funny, and dazzlingly dreamy, a look into the complicated inner lives of outwardly stoic souls. These stories warm and snap your heart all at once.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dean Bakopoulos, author of Summerlong</i></p><p>&#x201c;These stories kept me reading all night and filled my heart all day. From the surreal to the surprisingly spot-on, Nickolas Butler's greatest gift is his ability to report the rusty truth while still allowing the stainless steel soul of his characters to shine through. For every struggler, scrabbler and dead-ender in these stories, triumph--when it comes, <i>if </i>it comes may be ragged, but it is triumph nonetheless.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Perry, author of Coop and Truck</i></p><p>&#x201c;When I finished Nickolas Butler's stellar debut novel, I thought: Here's a man who sees the saint in all of us. Well, his vision is only getting stronger. The ten stories in <i>Beneath the Bonfire</i> are teeming with the sort of people I know best. Losers at love, failures as parents and daughters and sons, folks hardly able to make ends meet but always striving toward the good. His characters have hearts the size of Wisconsin without ever seeming like they're from anywhere other than the streets we grew up on. And though it hardly seems fair that one man should have access to so many beautiful and dented lives, I'm glad it's Nickolas Butler who does. He's the Midwestern bard I've been waiting my whole life for.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Geye, author of The Lighthouse Road and Safe from the Sea</i></p><p>&#x201c;There's a quiet heartbreak throughout <i>Beneath the Bonfire</i>. Every elemental staple pays off a tree, a chainsaw, a fire, the morel mushroom that blooms into the possible but unexpected disaster with a twist of Butler's mind and wrist. Another wonderful story collection that conjures all the craft of Denis Johnson's <i>Jesus' Son</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nicole Lea Helget, author of Stillwater</i></p><p>&#x201c;The stories in Nickolas Butler's <i>Beneath the Bonfire </i>highlight the strength in people during some of their weakest moments. The rich poetry in Butler's gut-wrenching prose makes for a stunning portrait of quiet life in small town America. A universally relatable voice, filled with heart and grit. A truly enjoyable read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marcus Burke, author of Team Seven</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sensitive to the human condition, Butler continues to demonstrate his impressive command of atmosphere and humanity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Butler seemingly came out of nowhere last year with <i>Shotgun Lovesongs</i>. No one had really heard of him, yet he wrote one of the best books of the year. And he continues his success in writing with <i>Beneath the Bonfire</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Spencer Daily Reporter</i></p><p>&#x201c;Impressively original.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times on Shotgun Lovesongs</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Shotgun Lovesongs</i> is the kind of book that restores your faith in humanity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Toronto Star</i></p><p>&#x201c;We all have them, right?

Striking in its versatility and diversity, Moroccan art has long influenced artists, architects, and designers. This volume, superbly illustrated with more than 150 original color photographs, brings the dazzling splendor of a thriving artisan tradition to a wider and increasingly appreciative international audience.<br>Vibrantly colored textiles; exquisitely crafted jewelry: finely worked leather, wood, metal; and an enormous collection of pottery and ceramics are all gathered together in this engaging guide by a leading Morroco scholar. These marvelous objects are inspired in form and content by the tribal lifestyle and powerful animistic beliefs of the nomadic artisans, as well as by the compelling aesthetic traditions of the Moslem world, giving each item's utility and remarkable beauty a spiritual resonance.<br>With a lively text describing traditional artistic forms and techniques, and a comprehensive analysis of the belief systems, festivals, and ceremonies to which the arts are linked, Arts and Crafts of Morocco will prove irresistible not only to those intrigued by this fascinating land, but also to collectors, designers, and anyone in search of original decorative ideas.</p><p>Visual artist Dr. James F. Jereb has devoted many years to the study of Morocco and its traditional arts. He is the creator of Stardreaming, Temples of the Cosmos, a 22-acre sacred stone temple labyrinth complex in Santa Fe, New Mexico.The authors of these informative and visually appealing books often discuss the individual crafts?both antique and contemporary?against a backdrop of historical and sociological issues. In their book on India, Cooper and Gillow, who have both written extensively on the topic, examine the influence of India's many ethnic groups on its crafts and culture. Items discussed range from folk murals and handmade paper to sophisticated musical instruments and intricately crafted jewelry. Of particular interest are the chapter that describes India's textile industry and the list of names and addresses of businesses worldwide selling Indian arts and crafts. Jereb approaches Morocco as an anthropologist, thoughtfully examining the differences between Bedouin and urban culture and often comparing the former to tribal concepts typical of Native Americans. Jereb covers all manner of common Moroccan items embellished with decorative motifs?pottery, tools, leather goods, metalwork, rugs and other textiles, jewelry, and woodwork?and because Moroccan crafts are so intricately tied to religious beliefs, he includes tattoos and talismans that ward off the "evil eye" as well. Warren focuses on common household goods and village crafts rather than the architecture and stylish interiors that were at the center of his previous book, Thai Style (Rizzoli, 1989). Thai textiles are beyond compare, and the discussion in this book is detailed, illustrated with vintage photos of costumes and sumptuous color plates of the textiles. Equally captivating are sections describing woodcarvings, theater masks and costumes, basketry, and floral creations. Although temple arts are not included, a section on contemporary Thai crafts presents a very interesting overview of Thailand's artistic achievements. The books on Morocco and Thailand are the latest entries in a series that has already documented the works of Indonesia, Mexico, and South America. All three well-laid-out and informative books offer glossaries, maps, stunning photographs, good bibliographies, and tips on collecting; all three would be worthwhile additions to most libraries with collection emphasizing arts, crafts, or travel.?Margarete Gross, Chicago P.L.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pinocchio: The Making of the Disney Epic</h2><p>In 1940, Walt Disney released his second feature film: <i>Pinocchio,</i> based on Carlo Collodi&#x2019;s 1883 Italian children&#x2019;s novel.

Now, for the first time, with uncompromising candor and profound admiration, she tells the story of Dashiell Hammett&#x2014;Hollywood screenwriter and high-flying author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man&#x2014;as she knew him. In Jo Hammett&#x2019;s earliest recollections, although her already famous father exists outside the sphere of the daily life she shares with her mother and sister, he writes to Jo frequently and visits when he can. Jo&#x2019;s memories of him are golden: She recalls a trip to the Santa Anita racetrack in a chauffeur-driven limousine, where Hammett plays more on the horses than he can afford; she recalls a Depression-era excursion to Beverly Hills and a splurge that would have supported an entire family for a month&#x2014;on a riding outfit. With more ambivalence, she remembers the 1950s, when she assumes her responsibility as the sole designated correspondent with her blacklisted, imprisoned father and her role as go-between for him and Lillian Hellman. The notorious Hammett-Hellman romance, Dash&#x2019;s rude flirtations, his heavy drinking, his attraction to Communism, his quirks and betrayals and paternal love&#x2014;Jo Hammett neither blinks at her father&#x2019;s faults nor diminishes his humanity. In straightforward prose, with unaffected charm, she offers in this generously illustrated volume a revealing personal reminiscence that contributes immeasurably to Hammett biography.</p><p>This short but compelling memoir is a must-read for anyone interested in the author of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man. Abetted by the most generous selection of photos ever to see print, it joins Lillian Hellman's writings on her years living with Hammett as one of the two comprehensive looks into his life from a personal viewpoint. Both portray an almost fiercely private individual "In our family much unsaid was nonetheless understood" but the paternal influence seems to have been passed on, with Jo Hammett commenting on her mother: "I realize that I didn't know her any more than my children know me." Insights and personal observations nonetheless build to a convincing portrait, with numerous humorous asides (comparing Hellman to good and bad cholesterol being quite the coup). The memoir encompasses several decades, with pictures bringing those eras to life, along with telling details in the text the fact, for example, that only two families on their block during the Depression owned a car. The cover price for this book is more than justified by the photographs, drawn from family archives, with a great many of these predating the previous "earliest known photo." Of particular interest to fans of Hammett's crime writing are several shots covering his years working as a Pinkerton operative and the time in San Francisco when he was writing the stories and novels that made his name. This is a perfect book for the Hammett enthusiast. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>*Starred Review* This is the memoir Lillian Hellman tried her best to suppress by threatening Hammett's daughter when she was a child. Now, with both Hammett and Hellman long gone, Jo Hammett breaks her silence to render what she calls a family portrait. She has her father's breezy, irreverent style, his way of capturing character in a few strokes--as in her revealing that her father, hospitalized during World War I, used to throw pie tins over the hospital partitions where the shell-shocked soldiers lay. No other Hammett biography has what his daughter's has--the first-time published family photos, many of them captioned by Hammett himself; an ad for diamond jewelry that Hammett wrote; the Manhattan night-school listing of a class called "Mystery Story Writing," taught by Hammett at the height of his fame; Hammett's confession to Jo that he believed he was "as bad an influence on American literature as anyone I can think of." Jo's unblinking portrayal of Hellman, "the Boogie Man of my childhood," skewers her as manipulative while admiring her audacity. Jo Hammett writes impressionistically, as memory takes her, with powerful effect. In a foreword, Richard Layman (editor of <i>Selected Letters of Dashiell Hammett</i> [BKL My 1 01], for which Jo Hammett was editorial advisor) provides a marvelous appreciation of both this memoir and Hammett himself. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Determining that by age ten children's minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime inducted nearly all German juveniles between the ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization. The result was a potent tool for bending young minds and hearts to the will of Adolf Hitler. </p><p> Baldur von Schirach headed a strict chain of command whose goal was to shift the adolescents' sense of obedience from home and school to the racially defined Volk and the Third Reich. Luring boys and girls into Hitler Youth ranks by offering them status, uniforms, and weekend hikes, the Nazis turned campgrounds into premilitary training sites, air guns into machine guns, sing-alongs into marching drills, instruction into indoctrination, and children into Nazis. A few resisted for personal or political reasons, but the overwhelming majority enlisted. </p><p> Drawing on original reports, letters, diaries, and memoirs, Kater traces the history of the Hitler Youth, examining the means, degree, and impact of conversion, and the subsequent fate of young recruits. Millions of Hitler Youth joined the armed forces; thousands gleefully participated in the subjugation of foreign peoples and the obliteration of "racial aliens." Although young, they committed crimes against humanity for which they cannot escape judgment. Their story stands as a harsh reminder of the moral bankruptcy of regimes that make children complicit in crimes of the state. </p></p><p><b>Michael H. Kater</b> is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus of History at York University, Toronto.Through the prism of the Hitler Youth organization, Michael Kater examines a wide variety of important issues confronting teenage boys and girls during the Third Reich. Faced with increasing pressures to adopt a racist ideology and stereotyped gender roles that conditioned them for war and genocide, they swayed between desire to conform and adolescent rebelliousness, which ranged from sexual promiscuity to (much too infrequent) political opposition. Kater's account, written with clarity and verve, moves freely between analytic generalizations and individual case studies, which cover the spectrum of political, emotional, cultural, and ethical responses to a vicious regime that tried-often successfully-to turn adolescents into its most pliant tools.<br> --Peter Jelavich, Professor of History, Johns Hopkins University and author of <i>Berlin Cabaret</i><br><br>An engaging study of the comradeship and feeling of belonging, sense of power and superiority imparted to Germany's young boys and girls as they became ideologically charged paramilitary men and women ready to serve, to follow orders and to sacrifice for Adolf Hitler. Kater has crafted a masterful history essential to comprehending Germany through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. This will be the definitive history of the Hitler Youth.<br> --Peter Loewenberg, Professor of History, UCLA and Dean of the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute<br><br>This important book is not only an excellent survey of the Nazi attempt to indoctrinate a generation of young Germans and those young men and women who resisted it, but a significant reflection on the problems of converting an indoctrinated generation to the values of democracy.<br> --Eric Hobsbawm, author of <i>Interesting Times: A Twentieth Century Life</i><br><br>Using letters, diaries and the recollections of former members of Hitler Youth--a paramilitary and ideological group in which membership, for both boys and girls, was eventually mandatory--Kater, a noted historian of the Nazis, concludes in this readable volume that 'the authoritarian nature of the Nazi regime' and its 'merciless' racial ideology, as well as its sense of community, underlay its appeal to 'adolescents who were searching for certitudes in a swiftly changing and newly structured world'...The Nazis took the youth movement concept, popular throughout Europe in the early 20th century, and adapted it to fit a racist ideology. He also shows that values of militarism and self-reliance clashed with German family values of nurturing--and that, for the most part, the Hitler Youth won out. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2004-08-23)<br><br>Kater looks at how the [Hitler Youth organization] undermined traditional morality while claiming to uphold it, and the brave but futile attempt at resistance. He believes that, while the "Hitler Youth" generation cannot completely escape culpability for the Hitler regime, moral guilt cannot be laid on wholesale. Ultimately, it was the political/social system their elders handed them that determined the way they would go.<br> --Roger K. Miller (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> 2004-11-21)<br><br><i>Hitler Youth</i> is as carefully comprehensive as it is morally careful. Kater is an expert compiler of data, beginning with the early 20th century roots of German youth leagues and ending with the hideous details of 12-year-olds being sent to fight on the front lines. He makes clear that the Hitler Youth instigated its share of atrocities, but also that its members were forced to face the gory reality of war, and suffer accordingly, at a terribly young age...Within the greater Nazi nightmare, the Youth are uniquely frightening.

Yet, in keeping with Kater's extensive scholarship on the Third Reich, <i>Hitler Youth</i> offers more than a straightforward social history.

Writers Charlotte and Peter Fiell argue that, as well as being an icon of identity, the chair is a form through which designers engage in social, political, and even ergonomic rhetoric. A good example is George Nelson's mass-produced modular seating system. Geometrical in design, its austere, mostly rectilinear lines are efficient and economical. The book follows developments and mutations in chair design from the days before art deco through the rise of modernity and into the mid-'90s, when designers like Philippe Starck used such materials as recycled plastic and injection molded polypropylene.<p> In total there are more than the 1000 advertised illustrations, and each is accompanied by a small text describing the significance of the chair and its designer. The book includes more than 100 capsule biographies of such designers as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Adolph Loos, and Marcel Breuer. The only problem with <i>1000 Chairs</i> is, ironically, its own ergonomics. At about eight by six inches and nearly 800 pages, it is an unwieldy little tome. That aside, this is a great book--a must for anyone interested in sitting down. <i>--Loren E. Baldwin</i></p>Charlotte &amp; Peter Fiell have written numerous TASCHEN books, including 1000 Chairs, Design of the 20th Century, Industrial Design A&#x2013;Z, Scandinavian Design, Designing the 21st Century, Graphic Design for the 21st Century, 1000 Lights, and Contemporary Graphic Design.

At the time, General Dwight Eisenhower, General Douglas MacArthur, and chief of staff Admiral William Leahy all agreed that an atomic attack on Japanese cities was unnecessary. All of them believed that Japan had already been beaten and that the war would soon end. Was the bomb dropped to end the war more quickly? Or did it herald the start of the Cold War? In his probing new study, prizewinning historian Ronald Takaki explores these factors and more. He considers the cultural context of race - the ways in which stereotypes of the Japanese influenced public opinion and policymakers - and also probes the human dimension. Relying on top secret military reports, diaries, and personal letters, Takaki relates international policies to the individuals involved: Los Alamos director J. Robert Oppenheimer, Secretary of State James Byrnes, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and others... but above all, Harry Truman.</p><p>Ronald Takaki is a professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.A widely accepted theory is that President Harry Truman ordered the atomic bomb dropped on Japan to end the war quickly and to avoid the massive casualties that would have occurred during an Allied invasion. That view, according to Takaki, is simplistic. He argues that Truman's overriding concern-American policy toward the Soviet Union-led him to hope that a combat demonstration of the bomb in Japan would lead to Soviet postwar cooperation and discourage that country's imperialist expansion. Takaki also contends that the President's readiness to use the bomb was linked to America's racial rage against the Japanese and to Truman's own racist attitudes. Takaki's Harry Truman will be unfamiliar to most readers: insecure, unable to say no to strong-willed officials such as Secretary of State James Byrnes, struggling to overcome his childhood identity as a sissy by means of macho behavior, suffering remorse over his historic decision. Right or wrong, the study is a provocative addition to the unresolved debate over the dropping of the atomic bombs. Takaki is a professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley.

While the former has been labelled the &#x201c;Father of Impressionism&#x201d; and is today a household name, the latter has sunk into obscurity. It is difficult now to believe that in 1864, when this story begins, it was Meissonier who was considered the greatest French artist alive and who received astronomical sums for his work, while Manet was derided for his messy paintings of ordinary people and had great difficulty getting any of his work accepted at the all-important annual Paris Salon. <br><br>Manet and Meissonier were the Mozart and Salieri of their day, one a dangerous challenge to the establishment, the other beloved by rulers and the public alike for his painstakingly meticulous oil paintings of historical subjects. Out of the fascinating story of their parallel careers, Ross King creates a lens through which to view the political tensions that dogged Louis-Napoleon during the Second Empire, his ignominious downfall, and the bloody Paris Commune of 1871. At the same time, King paints a wonderfully detailed and vivid portrait of life in an era of radical social change: on the streets of Paris, at the new seaside resorts of Boulogne and Trouville, and at the race courses and picnic spots where the new bourgeoisie relaxed. When Manet painted Dejeuner sur l&#x2019;herbe or Olympia, he shocked not only with his casual brushstrokes (described by some as applied by a &#x2018;floor mop&#x2019;) but with his subject matter: top-hatted white-collar workers (and their mistresses) were not considered suitable subjects for &#x2018;Art&#x2019;. Ross King shows how, benign as they might seem today, these paintings changed the course of history. The struggle between Meissonier and Manet to see their paintings achieve pride of place at the Salon was not just about artistic competitiveness, it was about how to see the world.<br><br>Full of fantastic tidbits of information (such as the use of carrier pigeons and hot-air balloons during the siege of Paris), and a colourful cast of characters that includes Baudelaire, Courbet, and Zola, with walk-on parts for Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cezanne, <b>The Judgment of Paris</b> casts new light on the birth of Impressionism and takes us to the heart of a time in which the modern French identity was being forged.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Ross King is the author of <b>Brunelleschi&#x2019;s Dome</b>, <b>Michelangelo and the Pope&#x2019;s Ceiling</b>, and the novels <b>Ex-Libris </b>and <b>Domino</b>. Born and raised in Canada, he now lives near Oxford, England.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><b>Chapter One<br><br>Chez Meissonier</b><br><br>One gloomy January day in 1863, �Jean-�Louis-�Ernest Meissonier, the world&#x2019;s wealthiest and most celebrated paint�er, dressed himself in the costume of Napoleon Bonaparte and, despite the snowfall, climbed onto the rooftop balcony of his mansion in Poissy.<br><br>A town with a population of a little more than 3,000, Poissy lay eleven miles northwest of Paris, on the south bank of an oxbow in the River Seine and on the railway line running from the Gare �Saint-�Lazare to the Normandy coast. It boasted a �twelfth-�century church, an equally ancient bridge, and a weekly cattle market that supplied the butcher shops of Paris and, every Tuesday, left the medieval streets steaming with manure. There was little �else in Poissy except for the ancient priory of �Saint-�Louis, a walled convent that had once been home to an order of Dominican nuns. The nuns had been evicted during the French Revolution and the convent&#x2019;s buildings either demolished or sold to private buyers. But inside the enclosure remained an enormous, spired church almost a hundred yards in length and, close by, a grandiose �house with clusters of balconies, dormer windows and �pink-�bricked chimneys: a building sometimes known as the Grande Maison.<br><br>Ernest Meissonier had occupied the Grande Maison for most of the previous two de�cades. In his �forty-�eighth year he was short, arrogant and densely bearded: &#x201c;ugly, little and mean,&#x201d; one observer put it, &#x201c;rather a scrap of a man.&#x201d;2 A friend described him as looking like a professor of gymnastics, and indeed the burly Meissonier was an eager and accomplished athlete, often rising before dawn to rampage through the countryside on �horse�back, swim in the Seine, or launch himself at an opponent, �fencing �sword in hand. Only after an hour or two of these exertions would he retire, sometimes still shod in his riding boots, to a studio in the Grande Maison where he spent ten or twelve hours each day crafting on his easel the wonders of precision and meticulousness that had made both his reputation and his fortune.<br><br>To overstate either Meissonier&#x2019;s reputation or his fortune would have been difficult in the year 1863. &#x201c;At no period,&#x201d; a contemporary claimed, &#x201c;can we point to a French paint�er to whom such high distinctions �were awarded, whose works �were so eagerly sought after, whose material interests �were so guaranteed by the high prices offered for every production of his brush.&#x201d; No artist in France could command Meissonier&#x2019;s extravagant prices or excite so much public attention. Each year at the Paris �Salon &#x2013; the annual art exhibition in the Palais des �Champs-�lys�es &#x2013; the space before Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings grew so thick with spectators that a special policeman was needed to regulate the masses as they pressed forward to inspect his latest success. Collected by wealthy connoisseurs such as James de Rothschild and the Duc d&#x2019;Aumale, these paintings proved such lucrative investments that Meissonier&#x2019;s signature was said to be worth that of the Bank of France. &#x201c;The prices of his works,&#x201d; noted one awestruck art critic, &#x201c;have attained formidable proportions, never before known.&#x201d;<br><br>Meissonier&#x2019;s success in the auction rooms was accompanied by a chorus of critical praise �and &#x2013; even more unusual for an art world riven by savage rivalries and piffling �jealousies &#x2013; the respect and admiration of his peers. &#x201c;He is the incontestable master of our epoch,&#x201d; declared Eug�ne Delacroix, who predicted to the poet Charles Baudelaire that &#x201c;amongst all of us, surely it is he who is most certain to survive!&#x201d; Another of Meissonier&#x2019;s friends, the writer Alexandre Dumas <i>fils</i>, called him &#x201c;<i>the</i> paint�er of France.&#x201d; He was simply, as a newspaper breathlessly reported, &#x201c;the most renowned artist of our time.&#x201d;<br><br>From his vantage point at the top of his mansion this most renowned artist could have seen all that his tremendous success had bought him. A stable �housed his eight �horses and a coach �house his fleet of carriages, which included expensive landaus, berlines, and victorias. He even owned the fastest vehicle on the road, a mail coach. All �were decorated, in one of his typically lordly gestures, with a crest that bore his most fitting motto: <i>Omnia labor</i>, or &#x201c;Everything by work.&#x201d; A green�house, a saddlery, an En�glish garden, a photographic workshop, a duck pond, lodgings for his coachman and groom, and a meadow planted with cherry �trees &#x2013; all �were ranged across a patch of land sloping down to the embankments of the Seine, where his two yachts �were moored. A dozen miles upstream, in the Rue des Pyramides, a fashionable street within steps of both the Jardin des Tuileries and the Louvre, he maintained his Paris apartment.<br><br>The Grande Maison itself stood between the convent&#x2019;s Gothic church and the remains of its ancient cloister. Meissonier had purchased the �pink-�bricked �eighteenth-�century orangery, which was sometimes known as Le Pavillon �Rose, in 1846. In the ensuing years he had spent hundreds of thousands of francs on its expansion and refurbishment in order to create a splendid palace for himself and his family. A turret had been built above an adjoining cottage to �house an enormous cistern that provided the Grande Maison with running water, which was pumped through the �house and garden by means of a steam engine. The �house also boasted a luxurious water closet and, to warm it in winter, a central heating system. A billiard room was available for Meissonier&#x2019;s rare moments away from his easel.<br><br>Yet despite these modern con�ve�niences, the Grande Maison was really intended to be an exquisite antiquarian daydream. &#x201c;My �house and my temperament belong to another age,&#x201d; Meissonier once said. He did not feel at home or at ease in the nineteenth century. He spoke unashamedly of the &#x201c;good old days,&#x201d; by which he meant the eighteenth century and even earlier. He detested the sight of railway stations, �cast-�iron bridges, modern architecture and recent fashions such as frock coats and top hats. He did not like how people sat �cross-�legged and read newspapers and cheap pamphlets instead of �leather-�bound books. And so from the outside his �house&#x2013;all gables, pitched roofs and leaded �windows &#x2013; was a vision of �eighteenth-�century elegance and tranquillity, while on the inside the rooms �were decorated in the style of Louis XV, with expensive tapestries, armoires, embroidered fauteuils, and carved wooden balustrades.<br><br>The Grande Maison included not one but, most unusually, two large studios in which Meissonier could paint his masterpieces. The <i>atelier d&#x2019;hiver</i>, or &#x201c;winter workshop,&#x201d; featuring bay windows and a large fireplace, was on the top floor of the �house, while at ground level, overlooking the garden, he had built a �glass-�roofed annex known as the <i>atelier d&#x2019;�t�</i>, or &#x201c;summer workshop.&#x201d; Both abounded with the tools of his trade: canvases, brushes and easels, but also musical instruments, suits of armor, bridles and harnesses, plumed helmets, and an assortment of halberds, rapiers and �muskets &#x2013; enough weaponry, it was said, to equip a company of mercenaries. For Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings �were, like his �house, recherch� figments of an antiquarian imagination. He specialized in scenes from �seventeenth- and �eighteenth-�century life, portraying an �ever-�growing cast of �silk-�coated and �lace-�ruffed �gentlemen &#x2013; what he called his <i>bonshommes</i>, or &#x201c;goodfellows&#x201d; &#x2013; playing chess, smoking pipes, reading books, sitting before easels or double basses, or posing in the uniforms of musketeers or halberdiers. These musicians and bookworms striking their quiet and reflective poses in serene, softly lit interiors, all executed in microscopic detail, bore uncanny similarities to the work of Jan Vermeer, an artist whose rediscovery in the 1860s owed much to the ravenous taste for �Meissonier &#x2013; and one whose tremendous current popularity approaches the enthusiastic esteem in which Meissonier himself was held in �mid-�nineteenth-�century France.<br><br>Typical of Meissonier&#x2019;s work was one of his most recent creations, <i>Halt at an Inn</i>, owned by the Duc de Morny, a wealthy art collector and the illegitimate half brother of the French Emperor, Napoleon III. Completed in 1862, it featured three �eighteenth-�century cavaliers in tricorn hats being served drinks on �horse�back outside a �half-�timbered rural tavern: a charming vignette of the days of old, without a railway train or top hat in sight. Meissonier&#x2019;s most famous painting, though, was <i>The Brawl</i>, a somewhat less decorous scene depicting a fight in a tavern between two men �dressed &#x2013; as �usual &#x2013; in opulent �eighteenth-�century attire. Awarded the Grand Medal of Honor at the Salon of 1855, it was owned by Queen Victoria, whose husband and consort, Prince Albert, had prized Meissonier above all other artists. At the height of the Crimean War, Napoleon III had purchased the work from Meissonier for 25,000 �francs &#x2013; eight times the annual salary of an average factory �worker &#x2013; and presented it as a gift to his ally across the Channel.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective of Drawings</h2><p>A seminal collection of drawings by the renowned Abstract Expressionist artist features some 170 illustrations, most in full color, that reveal the evolution of Gorky&#39;s art, the relationship between his drawings and his paintings, his stylistic evolution, and their place within the context of twentieth-century art.</p><p>Melvin P.

Is the way you think like the colour of your eyes - something you are born with and cannot alter? Or is thinking a skill that can be improved with practice, like swimming, tennis or cooking? In this practical book, Edward de Bono lays out some simple but powerful tools with which we can optimise our thinking, decision making and problem solving. Most of the errors of thinking are errors of perception and that is precisely where these tools help. It helps you learn: how to enhance your thinking processes by developing your perception; how to make the most of your thinking skills and how thinking differs from intelligence; and how to make decisions, and deal with emotions and values whilst focusing on the future. Edward de Bono, the inventor of the term &#39;lateral thinking&#39; is widely believed to be the world&#39;s leading authority on the direct teaching of thinking as a skill. He is the author of over 60 books and his methods are widely used in many countries. He advises multinational corporations and also works with education bodies to enable us to maximise our thinking abilities.</p><p></p><h2>Architectural Theory: From the Renaissance to the Present</h2><p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever wondered what goes through architects&#x2019; minds when they design buildings, you&#x2019;ll be happy to know that there&#x2019;s no shortage of brilliant reading material to satisfy your curiosity.

She cheerfully reveals the small mysteries of the physical world: what to do, for example, when there's not enough room to hammer a nail straight on (drive it in at an angle, a process called toenailing) and why ordinary screws don't screw in when one wants them to (drill a pilot hole first; or better yet, use pointed drywall screws). McCormick uses lay language, explains the proper, safe use of common and unusual tools, and provides hints on how to get help at hardware stores and lumber yards. There are abundant, clearly rendered and detailed line drawings and a short glossary for quick reference. McCormick is a professional carpenter and contractor who teaches house-building and carpentry. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.As something of a pioneering woman in the male-dominated carpentry trade, McCormick writes with conviction of the "empowerment" that comes with knowing how to fix things. Relating such knowledge to an understanding of how things work, McCormick places great emphasis on the powers of observation. While Housemending covers the same basics as other do-it-yourself manuals, i.e., tools and their use, wiring, plumbing, painting, emergency repairs, and so on, it does so with exceptional good sense and an eye for descriptive detail. For its many insights plus the tricks of the trade it generously shares, this is a worthwhile addition to any public library's how-to collection. Bill Demo, Tompkins Cortland Community Coll.

Murderers, rapists, and armed robbers were competing in the annual rodeo at Angola, the grim maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana. The convicts, sentenced to life without parole, were thrown, trampled, and gored by bucking bulls and broncos before thousands of cheering spectators. But amid the brutality of this gladiatorial spectacle Bergner caught surprising glimpses of exaltation, hints of triumphant skill.<br><br>The incongruity of seeing hope where one would expect only hopelessness, self-control in men who were there because they'd had none, sparked an urgent quest in him. Having gained unlimited and unmonitored access, Bergner spent an unflinching year inside the harsh world of Angola. He forged relationships with seven prisoners who left an indelible impression on him. There's Johnny Brooks, seemingly a latter-day Stepin Fetchit, who, while washing the warden's car, longs to be a cowboy and to marry a woman he meets on the rodeo grounds. Then there's Danny Fabre, locked up for viciously beating a woman to death, now struggling to bring his reading skills up to a sixth-grade level. And Terry Hawkins, haunted nightly by the ghost of his victim, a ghost he tries in vain to exorcise in a prison church that echoes with the cries of convicts talking in tongues. <br><br>Looming front and center is Warden Burl Cain, the larger-than-life ruler of Angola who quotes both Jesus and Attila the Hun, declares himself a prophet, and declaims that redemption is possible for even the most depraved criminal. Cain welcomes Bergner in, and so begins a journey that takes the author deep into a forgotten world and forces him to question his most closely held beliefs. The climax of his story is as unexpected as it is wrenching. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Rendered in luminous prose, <b>God of the Rodeo</b> is an exploration of the human spirit, yielding in the process a searing portrait of a place that will be impossible to forget and a group of men, guilty of unimaginable crimes, desperately seeking a moment of grace.</p><p>Not since Truman Capote's <i>In Cold Blood</i> has a writer so humanely evoked the complicated, harrowing lives of violent convicts. At turns haunting and inspiring, <i>God of the Rodeo</i> is novelist-journalist Daniel Bergner's riveting account of a year spent visiting the maximum-security prison at Angola, Louisiana, also known as "the last slave plantation." Initially there to report on the prison's annual four-weekend rodeo in October 1996 for <i>Harper's</i>, he was able to extend his stay for a full year when he was granted complete, unsupervised access to the seven prisoners with whom he became most closely acquainted.<p> In <i>God of the Rodeo</i>, he introduces readers to rodeo champion Johnny Brooks, a 41-year-old "lifer" incarcerated for a murder he committed at the age of 18, who is engaged to marry a civilian woman he met at the rodeo. He's also the most promising candidate for parole. There's Terry Hawkins, a man who tries to seek salvation for the violent murder of his boss, the grotesque details of which haunt him, and Danny Fabre, plagued with comically large ears he desperately wants corrected by plastic surgery almost as much as he wishes to learn to read past the 6th-grade level. Perhaps the most striking figure is the stern, spiritual warden, Burl Cain, a self-proclaimed prophet who genuinely believes in redemption for even the most violent offenders.</p><p> Written with the eloquence of a poet and the perceptive eyes of a painter, Bergner's extremely well wrought, unforgettable book offers a rare glimpse into the hearts and souls of men who commit violence, finding hope and courage where few dare to look, without ever losing sight of the horrific crimes that landed them in America's most isolated prison. <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p>"A story of such eloquence and brutality that, from time to time, I simply had to put the book down and think about what I had just read.

With the Nazi Party at the height of its power, the occupying army empties Poland&#x2019;s towns and cities of their Jewish populations. As neighbor turns on neighbor and survival often demands unthinkable choices, Poland has become a moral quagmire&#x2014;a place of shifting truths and blinding ambiguities.<br> <br>Blending folklore and fact, Helen Maryles Shankman shows us the people of Wlodawa, a remote Polish town: we meet a cold-blooded SS officer dedicated to rescuing the creator of his son&#x2019;s favorite picture book, even as he helps exterminate the artist&#x2019;s friends and family; a Messiah who appears in a little boy&#x2019;s bedroom to announce that he is quitting; a young Jewish girl who is hidden by the town&#x2019;s most outspoken anti-Semite&#x2014;and his talking dog. And walking among these tales are two unforgettable figures: the enigmatic and silver-tongued Willy Reinhart, Commandant of the forced labor camp who has grand schemes to protect &#x201c;his&#x201d; Jews, and Soroka, the Jewish saddlemaker and his family, struggling to survive.<br> <br>Channeling the mythic magic of classic storytellers like Sholem Aleichem and Isaac Bashevis Singer and the psychological acuity of modern-day masters like Nicole Krauss and Nathan Englander, <i>In the Land of Armadillos</i> is a testament to the persistence of humanity in the most inhuman conditions.</p><p>Helen Maryles Shankman&#x2019;s stories have been nominated for two Pushcart Prizes.

She lives in Southern California.</p>Grade 1-4 A brown-skinned mother hides her son and daughter under the bed when soldiers come to their home in the night. Afterwards, the father declares that they must flee immediately, taking with them only the things they can carry. Their journey is difficult, and they encounter many obstacles before they finally sight land and are towed ashore by a boat. They have landed in America, it is Thanksgiving Day, and this band of refugees is safe and free at last. Bunting's simple tale focuses on the hardships of the journey and on the American ideals of freedom and safety. She wisely leaves aside the issues of politics in the homeland or in this country. Her prose is poetically spare, as her runaways move ``silently along the secret streets.'' Peck's richly colored crayon drawings yield added enjoyment each time they are perused. The mood changes from dark shades of desperation during the journey to the lighter tones of joy as the travelers at last find their refuge. Other titles on this subject that are equally valuable are Barbara Cohen's Molly's Pilgrim (1983) and Gooseberries to Oranges (1982, both Lothrop).

Set in the mythical land of Prydain (which bears a more than passing resemblance to Wales), Lloyd Alexander's book draws together the elements of the hero's journey from unformed boy to courageous young man. Taran grumbles with frustration at home in the hamlet Caer Dallben; he yearns to go into battle like his hero, Prince Gwydion. Before the story is over, he has met his hero and fought the evil leader who threatens the peace of Prydain: the Horned King. <p> What brings the tale of Taran to life is Alexander's skillful use of humor, and the way he personalizes the mythology he has so clearly studied. Taran isn't a stick figure; in fact, the author makes a point of mocking him just at the moments when he's acting the most highhanded and heroic. When he and the young girl Eilonwy flee the castle of the wicked queen Achren, Taran emotes, "'Spiral Castle has brought me only grief; I have no wish to see it again.' 'What has it brought the rest of us?' Eilonway asked. 'You make it sound as though we were just sitting around having a splendid time while you moan and take on.'" By the end, Alexander has spun a rousing hero's tale and created a compelling coming-of-age story. Readers will sigh with relief when they realize <i>The Book of Three</i> is only the first of the chronicles of Prydain. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><i>Taran, The Assistant Pig-Keeper</i>, longs to be a hero.<p></p><p>He begins his journey with a strange assortment of companions on a dangerous mission to save his beloved land, Prydain. Packed with action, humor, romance, and gallantry, Taran's adventures chronicle his beloved Prydain and his battle with the forces of evil.</p></p><h2>The Greatest Survival Stories Ever Told: Seventeen Incredible Tales</h2><p>From the tropics to the Artic Poles (and everywhere in between), seventeen epic tales of survival. <br></p><p>Many survival adventures begin with the suddenness and randomness of a bolt of lightning - a storm descends, a boat overturns, a plane crashes, a ferocious animal attacks out of nowhere, a wilderness traveler becomes lost. Others, such as the adventures of intrepid explorers, emerge from man's inner desire to test the limits of human endurance, to challenge himself, and thereby etch himself a place in history. These are times, as Thomas Paine wrote, "that try men's souls" - times when the courage of a man is truly measured, where heroes are born, and where we learn, finally, that it is indeed only the strong who survive. Contributions include some well-known works from renowned writers of the genre such as Stephen Crane, Jack London, and Farley Mowat, as well as some rare, lesser-known gems from Slavomir Rawicz, Maurice Herzog, and Jon Krakauer. The seventeen stories in this fascinating collection will lead you from high in the Andes Mountains to the South Pole, across the arid Gobi desert and through the dense jungles of South Pacific islands, illustrating in vivid detail - through true and fictional tales - the harsh conditions and seemingly unbearable predicaments that serve to prove themselves the ultimate tests of human endurance, fortitude, and bravery.

He brings a certain notorious Paris theater to life with strange romance and artistic envy in "Grand Guignol." "The Premature Burials" finds a gothic erotic charge in being buried alive.

Does a monster inhabit its depths, or is it just myth? Why, after thousands of reported sightings and dozens of expeditions, is there still no hard evidence? Marine biologist Zachery Wallace knows, but the shock of his near-drowning as a child on Loch Ness have buried all memories of the incident. Now, a near-death experience suffered while on expedition in the Sargasso Sea has caused these long-forgotten memories to re-surface. Haunted by vivid night terrors, stricken by a sudden fear of the water, Zach finds he can no longer function as a scientist. Unable to cope, his career all but over, he stumbles down a path of self-destruction...until he receives contact from his estranged father...a man he has not seen since his parents' divorced and he left Scotland as a boy.<p> Angus Wallace, a wily Highlander who never worked an honest day in his life, is on trial for murdering his business partner. Only Zachary can prove his innocence - if he is innocent, but to do so means confronting the nightmare that nearly killed him seventeen years earlier.</p><p> Incorporating the latest research and "new evidence," that leads to real answers concerning the monster's identity, best-selling author Steve Alten weaves a tale of horror about the most publicized and controversial creature ever to exist.</p></p><p>A native of Philadelphia, Steve Alten holds a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Penn State University, a masters in sports medicine from the University of Delaware, and a doctorate in sports administration from Temple University. He is the New York Times bestselling author of <i>MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror</i> and <i>Domain.</i><b>Chapter One</b> <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Sargasso Sea, Atlantic Ocean 887 miles due east of Miami Beach <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The Sargasso Sea is a two- million- square- mile expanse of warm water, adrift in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. An oasis of calm that borders no coastline, the sea is littered with sargassum, a thick seaweed that once fooled Christopher Columbus into believing he was close to land. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The Sargasso is constantly moving, its location determined by the North Equatorial and Gulf Stream currents, as well as those of the Antilles, Canary, and Caribbean. These interlocking forces stabilize the sea like the eye of a great hurricane, while causing its waters to rotate clockwise. As a result, things that enter the Sargasso are gradually drawn toward its center like a giant shower drain, where they eventually sink to the bottom, or, in the case of oil, form thick tar balls and float. There is a great deal of oil in the Sargasso, and with each new spill the problem grows worse, affecting all the sea creatures that inhabit the region. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The Sargasso marks the beginning of my tale and its end, and perhaps that is fitting, for all things birthed in this mysterious body of water eventually return here to die, or so I have learned. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> If each of us has his or her own Sargasso, then mine was the Highlands of Scotland. I was born in the village of Drumnadrochit, seven months and twenty- five years ago, give or take a few days. My mother, Andrea, was American, a quiet soul who came to the United Kingdom on holiday and stayed nine years in a bad marriage. My father, Angus Wallace, the cause of its termination, was a brute of a man, possessing jet- black hair and the piercing blue eyes of the Gael, the wile of a Scot, and the temperament of a Viking. An only child, I took my father&#x2019;s looks and, thankfully, my mother&#x2019;s disposition. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Angus&#x2019;s claim to fame was that his paternal ancestors were descendants of the great William Wallace himself, a name I doubt most non- Britons would have recognized until Mel Gibson portrayed him in the movie Braveheart. As a child, I often asked Angus to prove we were kin of the great Sir William Wallace, but he&#x2019;d merely tap his chest and say, "Listen, runt, some things ye jist feel. When ye become a real man, ye&#x2019;ll ken whit I mean." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> I grew to calling my father Angus and he called me his "runt"and neither was meant as an endearing term. Born with a mild case of hypotonia, my muscles were too weak to allow for normal development, and it would be two years (to my father&#x2019;s embarrassment) before I had the strength to walk. By the time I was five I could run like a deer, but being smaller than my burly, big- boned Highland peers, I was always picked on. Weekly contests between hamlets on the football pitch (rugby field) were nightmares. Being fleet of foot meant I had to carry the ball, and I&#x2019;d often find myself in a scrum beneath boys twice my size. While I lay bleeding and broken on the battlefield, my inebriated father would prance about the sidelines, howling with the rest of his drunken cronies, wondering why the gods had cursed him with such a runt for a son. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> According to the child- rearing philosophy of Angus Wallace, tough love was always best in raising a boy. Life was hard, and so childhood had to be hard, or the seedling would rot before it grew. It was the way Angus&#x2019;s father had raised him, and his father&#x2019;s father before that. And if the seedling was a runt, then the soil had to be tilled twice as hard. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> But the line between tough love and abuse is often blurred by alcohol, and it was when Angus was inebriated that I feared him most. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> His final lesson of my childhood left a lasting impression. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> It happened a week before my ninth birthday. Angus, sporting a whisky buzz, led me to the banks of Aldourie Castle, a three- century- old chateau that loomed over the misty black waters of Loch Ness. "Now pay attention, runt, for it&#x2019;s time I telt ye o&#x2019; the Wallace curse. My faither, yer grandfaither, Logan Wallace, he died in these very waters when I wis aboot yer age. An awfy gale hit the Glen, an&#x2019; his boat flipped. Everyone says he drooned, but I ken better, see. &#x2019;Twis the monster that got him, an&#x2019; ye best be warned, for&#x2014;" <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Monster? Are ye talkin&#x2019; aboot Nessie?"I asked, pie- eyed. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Nessie? Nessie&#x2019;s folklore. I&#x2019;m speakin&#x2019; o&#x2019; a curse wrought by nature, a curse that&#x2019;s haunted the Wallace men since the passin&#x2019; o&#x2019; Robert the Bruce." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "I dinnae understand." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Growing angry, he dragged me awkwardly to the edge of Aldourie Pier. "Look doon, laddie. Look doon intae the Loch an&#x2019; tell me whit ye see?" <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> I leaned out carefully over the edge, my heart pattering in my bony chest. "I dinnae see anythin&#x2019;, the water&#x2019;s too black." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Aye, but if yer eyes could penetrate the depths, ye&#x2019;d see intae the dragon&#x2019;s lair. The de&#x2019;il lurks doon there, but it can sense oor presence, it can smell the fear in oor blood. By day the Loch&#x2019;s ours, for the beast prefers the depths, but God help ye at night when she rises tae feed." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "If the monster&#x2019;s real, then I&#x2019;ll rig a lure an&#x2019; bring her up." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Is that so? An&#x2019; who be ye? Wiser men have tried an&#x2019; failed, an&#x2019; looked foolish in their efforts, whilst a bigger price wis paid by those drowned who ventured out oot night." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Ye&#x2019;re jist tryin&#x2019; tae scare me. I&#x2019;m no&#x2019; feart o&#x2019; a myth." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Tough words. Very well, runt, show me how brave ye are. Dive in. Go on, laddie, go for a swim and let her get a good whiff o&#x2019; ye." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> He pushed me toward the edge and I gagged at his breath, but held tight to his belt buckle. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Jist as I thought." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Frightened, I pried myself loose and ran from the pier, the tears streaming down my cheeks. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Ye think I&#x2019;m hard on ye, laddie? Well, life&#x2019;s hard, an&#x2019; I&#x2019;m nothin&#x2019; compared tae that monster. Ye best pay attention, for the curse skips every other generation, which means ye&#x2019;re marked. That dragon lurks in the shadow o&#x2019; yer soul, and one day ye&#x2019;ll cross paths. Then what will ye dae? Will ye stand and fight like a warrior, like brave Sir William an&#x2019; his kin, or will ye cower an&#x2019; run, lettin&#x2019; the dragon haunt ye for the rest o&#x2019; yer days?" <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Leaning out over the starboard rail, I searched for my reflection in the Sargasso&#x2019;s glassy surface. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Seventeen years had passed since my father&#x2019;s "dragon"lecture, seventeen long years since my mother had divorced him and moved us to New York. In that time I had lost my accent and learned that my father was right, that I was indeed haunted by a dragon, only his name was Angus Wallace. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Arriving in a foreign land is never easy for a boy, and the physical and psychological baggage I carried from my childhood left me fodder for the bullies of my new school. At least in Drumnadrochit I had allies like my pal, True MacDonald, but here I was all alone, a fish out of water, and there were many a dark day that I seriously considered ending my life. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> And then I met Mr. Tkalec. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Joe Tkalec was our middle school&#x2019;s science teacher, a kind Croatian man with rectangular glasses, a quick wit, and a love for poetry. Seeing that the "Scottish weirdo"was being picked on unmercifully, Mr. Tkalec took me under his wing, allowing me special classroom privileges like caring for his lab animals, small deeds that helped nurture my self- image. After school, I&#x2019;d ride my bike over to Mr. Tkalec&#x2019;s home, which contained a vast collection of books. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "Zachary, the human mind is the instrument that determines how far we&#x2019;ll go in life. There&#x2019;s only one way to develop the mind and that&#x2019;s to read. My library&#x2019;s yours, select any book and take it home, but return only after you&#x2019;ve finished it." <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The first volume I chose was the oldest book in his collection, The Origins of an Evolutionist, my eyes drawn by the author&#x2019;s name, Alfred Russel Wallace. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> Born in 1823, Alfred Wallace was a brilliant British evolutionist, geographer, anthropologist, and theorist, often referred to as Charles Darwin&#x2019;s right- hand man, though their ideas were not always in step. In his biography, Alfred mentioned that he too was a direct descendant of William Wallace, making us kin, and that he also suffered childhood scars brought about by an overbearing father. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> The thought of being related to Alfred Wallace instantly changed the way I perceived myself, and his words regarding adaptation and survival put wind in my fallen sails. <p></p> &nbsp; <p></p> "...we have here an acting cause to account for that balance so often observed in Nature&amp;...</p><h2>Epic Battles of the Civil War, Volume 2: Shiloh (Historical comics)</h2><p>Epic Battles of the Civil War, Volume 2: Shiloh (Historical comics)</p><p></p><h2>The Girl in Rose: Haydn&#39;s Last Love</h2><p>Rebecca Schroeter, a&nbsp;talented musician herself, was seldom on stage, but always at the center of the bustle and socializing off it.

'That would be the death of all existing retirees.'"<p>It's no secret that hundreds of companies have been slashing pensions and health coverage earned by millions of retirees. Employers blame an aging workforce, stock market losses, and spiraling costs- what they call "a perfect storm" of external forces that has forced them to take drastic measures.</p><p>But this so-called retirement crisis is no accident. Ellen E. Schultz, award-winning investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal, reveals how large companies and the retirement industry-benefits consultants, insurance companies, and banks-have all played a huge and hidden role in the death spiral of American pensions and benefits. <br>A little over a decade ago, most companies had more than enough set aside to pay the benefits earned by two generations of workers, no matter how long they lived. But by exploiting loopholes, ambiguous regulations, and new accounting rules, companies essentially turned their pension plans into piggy banks, tax shelters, and profit centers.</p><p>Drawing on original analysis of company data, government filings, internal corporate documents, and confidential memos, Schultz uncovers decades of widespread deception during which employers have exaggerated their retiree burdens while lobbying for government handouts, secretly cutting pensions, tricking employees, and misleading shareholders. She reveals how companies: </p><ul> <li>Siphon billions of dollars from their pension plans to finance downsizings and sell the assets in merger deals </li> <li>Overstate the burden of rank-and-file retiree obligations to justify benefits cuts while simultaneously using the savings to inflate executive pay and pensions </li> <li>Hide their growing executive pension liabilities, which at some companies now exceed the liabilities for the regular pension plans </li> <li>Purchase billions of dollars of life insurance on workers and use the policies as informal executive pension funds. When the insured workers and retirees die, the company collects tax-free death benefits </li> <li>Preemptively sue retirees after cutting retiree health benefits and use other legal strategies to erode their legal protections. <p></p> <p>Though the focus is on large companies-which drive the legislative agenda-the same games are being played at smaller companies, non-profits, public pensions plans and retirement systems overseas. Nor is this a partisan issue: employees of all political persuasions and income levels-from managers to miners, pro- football players to pilots-have been slammed.</p> <p><i>Retirement Heist</i> is a scathing and urgent expose of one of the most critical and least understood crises of our time.</p> </li></ul></p><p>Ellen E.

President Teddy Roosevelt's eldest, Longworth (1884-1980) was born to privilege and made the most of it. During a lifetime of travels, teas and dinner parties, she pulled social pranks and cast cruel barbs at those who failed her expectations, such as her husband, popular House Speaker Nicholas Longworth, and her reticent daughter Pauline (whose father, the author hints, was Idaho Sen. William Borah). She also despised cousins Eleanor and FDR, but nevertheless demolished his 1944 election opponent, Tom Dewey, as "the little man on the wedding cake." Syndicated book columnist Felsenthal aptly captures period flavor in a narrative well stocked with anecdotes and conversations between the vibrant Longworth and a circle of acquaintances that included the dowager empress of China, Warren G. Harding, Nixon, Joseph McCarthy, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Castro and Ezra Pound. At age 96, "too frail to support her hats," the darling of public, press and many ambitious politicians died in a decaying Washington mansion once bright with celebrity. Although the biography is lively and interesting, Felsenthal does not probe behind the legend, leaving the reader to wonder whether being a "fascinating conversationalist" merits such lasting notoriety. Photos. BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, Alice Roosevelt Longworth has been known primarily by two quotations: her father's observation that he could be President or could control young Alice, but could not do both; and her own comment, after a second mastectomy, that she was Washington's "topless octogenarian." Growing up as an unwanted stepchild, Alice early learned to get attention by being outrageous. She was hostess and friend to generations of politicians, from Coolidge to the Kennedys and Nixon (though an implacable enemy of her cousin, FDR). Felsenthal's biography is the best to date, a well done and fascinating account of a fascinating woman. Nancy C. Cridland, Indiana Univ.

Oppressive smoke from nearby wildfires grows ever denser, the story's ticking bomb. James, a wanderer with a stolen gun and a wallet full of his stepfather's cash, heads Bridget and Ruth's way, tracking his dead biological father, guided by a handful of photographs and the rumors of some hobos. The hateful sexuality simmering behind Bridget and Ruth's friendship explodes into a relatively predictable m�nage � trois that kicks off a storm of violence, dramatically coinciding with the inescapable arrival of the wildfires. The relationships here are more complicated than they seem&#x2014;the uncanny physical resemblance between James and Bridget provides a mystery that's easy for the reader to solve, but it's fascinating to watch Ruth misunderstand the obvious over and over, her clarity fogged by too many drinks and an inability to see her own value.

The latest in the Megatokyo series (see the Top 10 on p. 1304), this mix of romanticism and absurdity finds Piro and Largo still stuck in Japan and getting into more trouble. Piro is his usual mopey, romantic self, finding things he likes in all his new female friends, but never managing to tell any of them how he feels. His conscience, Seraphim, admonishes his lack of confidence, but seems to have troubles of her own to deal with after an old rival shows up. Meanwhile, Largo, the video-game geek, becomes a special agent for the Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division. He uses his position to fortify the MegaGamers store from demons, which he insists are on their way. Gallagher's art is a thing of beauty; partial shading adds a gentle softness to his <i>manga</i> style. Also included in this volume are notes and a stand-alone story featuring different characters.

Her forced marriage to Lord Gisbourne threatens Robin and Scarlet&#39;s love, and as the royal court descends upon Nottingham for the appointment of a new Sheriff, the people of Nottingham hope that Prince John will appoint their beloved Robin Hood. But Prince John has different plans for Nottingham that revolve around a fateful secret from Scarlet&#39;s past even she isn&#39;t yet aware of. Forced to participate at court alongside her ruthless husband, Scarlet must bide her time and act the part of a noblewoman-a worthy sacrifice if it means helping Robin&#39;s cause and a chance at a future with the man she loves. With a fresh line of intrigue and as much passion as ever, the next chapter in Scarlet&#39;s tale will have readers talking once again.</p><p><b>A. C. Gaughen</b> is the author of <i>Scarlet</i>. She serves as the Director of Girls' Leadership for Boston GLOW, a non-profit organization that creates opportunities to encourage and engage teen girls in the greater Boston area. She holds a masters degree in Creative Writing from St. Andrews University in Scotland and currently lives in Boston, Massachusetts, where she is pursuing her Masters in Education from Harvard University.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Dreading what is in store for her but determined to rid herself of a vile husband, Lady Marian (aka Scarlet) agrees to return to the castle as Gisbourne's wife, in order to obtain an annulment and marry Robin Hood, her true love. Rob rightly fears for her life, but Scar is adamant that the end will justify the means. Finding life as a lady more than difficult, she defies Gisbourne's every request while continuing to aid the commoners. Her adventures as a "lady thief" are brought to a halt, however, when she learns that she is not the natural daughter of Lord and Lady Leaford but rather the out-of-wedlock child of King Richard the Lionheart himself. Consumed by jealousy from the news, Prince John, the monarch's incompetent brother, cuts off two of her fingers, has Gisbourne hanged, and then blames it on Scar. As with Scarlet (Walker, 2012), this sequel is filled with action, suspense, and a healthy dash of passionate but controlled romance. The story is well plotted and suitably paced with realistic, spot-on dialogue true to the characters and their status. Unusual vocabulary is clarified within the text, although some words are only explained pages after their initial use. There is some cursing, but it's not gratuitous. Primary and secondary characters are fully developed and carefully wrought details of castle life and the Crusades flesh out the historical context. A must for secondary and public libraries that purchased the first book, this sequel will capture teen interest, and could also serve as a high-energy read-aloud. It will prove a good companion piece to Howard Pyle's classic The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood and a welcome addition for libraries wishing to promote strong female protagonists.&#x2014;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, formerly at LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</p><h2>Creepshow</h2><p>Stories in comic strip form tell of a murdered man returning from the grave, a bizarre meteor, a monster that devours people, a husband&#39;s terrible revenge, and a plague of cockroaches</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than&nbsp;fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(co-written with his son Owen King),&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>, the short story collection&nbsp;<i>The Bazaar of Bad Dreams</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and now an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series),&nbsp;<i>Doctor Sleep</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Under&nbsp;the Dome</i>.

As a result of the credit crisis, many financial institutions have raised their credit score requirements. Credit scores are impacting everyone from every angle. The Road to 850 provides a much greater background and understanding to the credit scoring system than any previously published book. In fact, The Road to 850 has been given the coveted endorsement of the AFCPE - American Financial Counseling, Planning and Education Association in June 2009. In its review, they write, The Road to 850 &#34;covers in detail the vast credit industry and navigates with ease the questions that plague even &#34;qualified&#34; people.&#34; It is &#34;highly recommended for financial and credit counselors as well as all individuals wanting to increase their scores-which would be everyone.&#34; The Road to 850 describes how credit risk is scored. It explains the four critical ratios, the four important dates and the four levels of delinquency. Lastly, it provides 94 proven strategies and identifies the requirements for a credit score in the golden range -- 760 to 850. The Road to 850 has received many additional rave reviews from readers: &#34;What an excellent book! Easy to read. Thanks a lot for giving us the opportunity to get to 850!&#34;, &#34;My book is filled with great information, some of which I have never heard before despite an abiding interest in the subject and previous research. I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who wants to raise his score, even if it&#39;s already a high one. This book is priceless.&#34; The Road to 850 has been highlighted by Kurtis Ming (KOVR / CBS in Sacramento), Nicole Crites (KPHO / CBS in Phoenix), Bill Gephardt (KUTV / CBS in Salt Lake City), Paula Ebbers (WBZ / CBS in Boston) and a host of other national television and radio reporters. Whether you have a 725 or a 525 credit score, this is one book you must have! A companion of The Road to 850 is the video series, The Quest for 850.

A native of Oregon, Elyse attended Williamette University and spent over ten years as a dental assistant before moving to writing full-time. </p><p>Since then, she has been successful in nearly every form she has attempted. The author of children&#x2019;s picture books, numerous historical novels, and even a devotional for caregivers, Elyse has also been published in many periodicals including Guideposts, Reader&#x2019;s Digest, and The Christian Reader.

He glanced at the crimson liquid oozing from his bandaged leg, and the steady stream leaking from his upper left arm.<br> <br> So much for winning the Fight Club Grand Championship. Previous champions had earned themselves prime positions within the Emperor&#x2019;s military ranks. Long had earned himself a target on his head.<br> <br> Balanced across Long&#x2019;s powerful shoulders was the unconscious giant of a man known as Xie&#x2014;the Scorpion. Xie had been the Emperor&#x2019;s personal bodyguard, but as of a quarter of an hour ago, he was, like Long, a fugitive.<br> <br> Long had to keep moving. Soldiers would surely be racing after them, following the directions of the new Southern Warlord&#x2014;Tonglong, the Mantis. However, Long had no time to consider them or their whereabouts. He had a more pressing matter to deal with. He needed to lower his pulse. If he kept going at this pace, his racing heart would soon pump his body dry.<br> <br> Long&#x2014;the Dragon&#x2014;began a breathing sequence that would decrease his heart rate in order to slow his blood flow. Two short breaths in, one long one out. He felt a difference immediately.<br> <br> He continued along the tunnel&#x2019;s dirt floor, but a stirring sensation in his dan tien&#x2014;his chi center&#x2014;brought a sudden sense of dread. His lower abdomen began to warm and his intestines started writhing like a ball of snakes. Someone was coming.<br> <br> &#x201c;Golden Dragon?&#x201d; a tiny voice whispered from down the dark corridor behind him. &#x201c;Long? Are you there?&#x201d;<br> <br> Long stopped and frowned. It was ShaoShu&#x2014;Little Mouse. ShaoShu had used Long&#x2019;s fight club name: Golden Dragon. Long turned and watched the small boy with the unusually limber body scamper toward him from the direction he had come from.<br> <br> &#x201c;Turn back, ShaoShu,&#x201d; Long whispered. &#x201c;Return to Tonglong. You will not be safe with me.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; ShaoShu replied. &#x201c;I want to help. You&#x2019;re injured and&#x2014; Hey!&#x201d; he squeaked, pointing at Xie. &#x201c;Xie is alive! His arm just moved. How can that be? I watched Tonglong shoot him in the chest.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;Xie is wearing battle armor beneath his robe,&#x201d; Long said. &#x201c;The shock from Tonglong&#x2019;s bullet just knocked him out. He probably has a cracked rib or two, but that&#x2019;s it. He should be fine once he wakes up.&#x201d;<br> <br> ShaoShu stared at Long&#x2019;s bulging arms and thick chest. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re carrying him and battle armor? You&#x2019;re barely a man. How did you get so strong?&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;Exercise,&#x201d; Long replied. &#x201c;Now shoo.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;But I can help,&#x201d; ShaoShu said. &#x201c;Did you see what happened back there with the Emperor and Tonglong? You can&#x2019;t do this alone.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;I saw,&#x201d; Long said. &#x201c;Tonglong killed Xie&#x2019;s father&#x2014;the Western Warlord. He also killed his own mother, AnGangseh. He&#x2019;s crazy, but he has managed to put himself in a position to kidnap the Emperor, and that makes him dangerous and powerful.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;Crazy is right,&#x201d; ShaoShu said. &#x201c;He will kill you, too, if you&#x2019;re caught. Why are you carrying Xie around? Just leave him. He&#x2019;s always been mean to you.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;If my temple brothers and sisters are to have any chance of stopping Tonglong from taking over the country, we are going to need Xie&#x2019;s help. He is still a very powerful man. In fact, he is the Western Warlord now. He&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br> Long stopped in midsentence as he saw ShaoShu&#x2019;s body go rigid and his nose twitch.<br> <br> &#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; ShaoShu said.<br> <br> Long focused his attention down the dark fight club tunnel beyond ShaoShu, and his dan tien began to twist and turn. More people were coming.<br> <br> &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Long whispered to ShaoShu. &#x201c;You must either return to Tonglong right now or escape on your own. You can&#x2019;t stay with me.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x201c;I will get Xie to safety, then I will rendezvous with my brothers and sister far to the north. Now go.&#x201d;<br> <br> Long whirled around to leave, but his foot slipped in a pool of his own blood. He lost his balance, and Xie&#x2019;s gigantic body shifted across his shoulders, dragging him to one side. His injured leg collapsed, and he went down. Xie&#x2019;s head bounced off the tunnel wall, the impact waking him instantly.<br> <br> Xie sat up, fully alert, like a seasoned fighter who had been knocked out only to wake up swinging.<br> <br> &#x201c;What is going on?&#x201d; Xie demanded, staggering to his feet. He tottered, then centered himself and stood solid as a mountain. He rubbed his head with one hand and felt the dent in his chest plate with the other.<br> <br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re being hunted,&#x201d; Long said. He watched as first recognition and then memory flowed behind Xie&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br> Xie growled and glared back up the tunnel.<br> <br> Long spun around to see two soldiers approaching, one tall and one short. Each held a cocked pistol. The soldiers stopped just out of Long&#x2019;s and Xie&#x2019;s reach. The taller of the two cleared his throat.<br> <br> &#x201c;Our apologies, sir,&#x201d; the taller soldier said to Xie, &#x201c;but you are under arrest. Southern Warlord Tonglong has ordered us to capture you, as well as Golden Dragon. Both of you, please come with us and maintain a reasonable distance. Our orders are to take you dead or alive. We will not hesitate to shoot either of you if you come too close or attempt to flee.&#x201d;<br> <br> Long&#x2019;s heart sank. In a traditional scuffle they might stand a chance, but against firearms combined with a short distance, all the kung fu skills on the planet would not help. He looked over to see ShaoShu&#x2019;s reaction, but ShaoShu was gone.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Millennium People</h2><p><p><strong>Violent rebellion comes to London's middle classes.</strong></p><p>As he searches for the truth behind the Heathrow bomb that killed his ex-wife, psychologist David Markham infiltrates a shadowy protest group based in the comfortable Chelsea Marina.

James Boswell and Goethe proclaimed it a masterpiece. And from the beginning Sterne realized he had written a book that would not suit everyone&#39;s taste. For more than two centuries. Tristram Shandy (1759-67) has astounded - and by turns confounded, captivated, angered, and amused but ever entertained - readers worldwide. While on the surface a comic, disjointed account of the title character&#39;s life and times, the work is in fact a brilliant commentary on life&#39;s inherent chaos, the pointed challenge of British clergy-man-turned-author Laurence Sterne to the twin concepts of rationalism and sentimentalism. Delineating his views through skillfully drawn representations - among them Tristram, Yorick, and Uncle Toby - Sterne pinpointed issues central to not only his era but our own. Filled with thought-provoking ideas and marked by an open, conversational writing style, Tristram Shandy: A Book for Free Spirits is an adroit guide to understanding the aims and achievements of Sterne&#39;s masterpiece and to fully appreciating its lessons for contemporary times.</p><p>The eight essays in this collection offer a substantial introduction to Sterne&#39;s satiric masterpiece, Tristram Shandy. According to Melvyn New&#39;s combative and engaging &#34;lntroduction Polemical&#34;, they share an interest in the traditions from which Tristram emerged and a turning away from the now dated attempt to make Sterne &#34;one of us&#34;, a modern existentialist.

Yet marital therapy has lacked a conceptual framework for matching treatment to a couple's particular problem. This outstanding new book, by a team of researcher-clinicians from the Center for Family Learning, is the first to address this deficiency.The authors systematically assess the duration and intensity of a couple's present conflict, as well as how the spouses function alone and in their extended families. They have found that troubled couples tend to fall into one of four categories, each best suited to a particular treatment program. The mild conflicts of stage one, for example, respond well to a six-week educational program; whereas the extreme anger and alienation of stage three is best handled without direct confrontation.The authors describe their evaluation and treatment procedures&#x2014;including assessing multigenerational systems, dealing with triangles, and reducing emotional arousal&#x2014;and illustrate their explanations with lengthy case illustrations and session-by-session transcripts. Because it offers a carefully articulated, clinically tested method of treating a broad range of marital problems, this valuable book makes a unique and much-needed contribution to the field.</p><p>Couples seek therapy for a variety of reasons, from short-lived adjustment difficulties to deeply entrenched conflict.

A year of shattering political crisis, 1973 was defined by defeat in Vietnam, Roe v. Wade, the oil crisis and the Watergate hearings. It was also a year of remarkable creative ferment. From landmark movies such as <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>Mean Streets,</i> and <i>American Graffiti </i>to seminal books such as <i>Fear of Flying </i>and <i>Gravity's Rainbow,</i> from the proto-punk band the New York Dolls to the first ever reality TV show, <i>The American Family</i>, the cultural artifacts of the year reveal a nation in the middle of a serious identity crisis. <i>1973 Nervous Breakdown</i> offers a fever chart of a year of uncertainty and change, a year in which post-war prosperity crumbled and modernism gave way to postmodernism in a lively and revelatory analysis of one of the most important periods in the second half of the 20th century.</p></p><p><p><b>Andreas Killen</b> is Assistant Professor of History at the City College of New York. He is the author of <i>Berlin Electropolis</i>, and his writing has appeared in <i>Salon</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>.</p>If you're old enough to remember 1973 -- and if you aren't, consider yourself lucky -- you know one thing for sure: It was a bummer. Watergate, busing, white flight, Patty Hearst, Andy Warhol, "Deep Throat," blaxploitation flicks, "Last Tango in Paris," Gravity's Rainbow, "An American Family," Vietnam, POWs, the "Me Decade," Fear of Flying, the economy down the tube, endless gas lines, "The Exorcist" -- was there anything good about 1973? Here's what Andreas Killen has to say: <p>"Taken as a whole, . . . 1973 [was] a cultural watershed, a moment of major realignments and shifts in American politics, culture, and society. This year marked not just the end of the sixties but the onset of a debate, one that continues to this day, about the legacy of that turbulent decade. At the same time this year was alive with a sense of new possibilities and openings to the future, harbingers of an emerging new postmodern cultural configuration." </p><p>Depends on where you sit, doesn't it? The cultural matters about which Killen writes -- all those mentioned above, along with the decline of modernism in architecture and other disciplines and the rise of postmodernism, the "cult of celebrity," the emergence of the all-encompassing mass media -- arouse more enthusiasm in him than they do in me. At the time, I thought it was all pretty exciting -- I was in my early thirties and lapped up all those newly liberated books and movies with unbecoming pleasure -- but little of it has survived the passage of time. </p><p>Thus in 1973, Andy Warhol, for example, seemed sort of, well, neat -- all those soup cans and Marilyn Monroe and Chairman Mao. We didn't understand at the time that Warhol's only genius was for trivializing everything on which he set his hands, that Mao was a monster to rank with Hitler and Stalin, that the druggy environment in which Warhol dwelled was self-destructive rather than glamorous. To his credit, Killen, a historian at the City College of New York, understands this even as he laments Warhol's "movement away from art and his increasing absorption into the worlds of music, film, and fashion." This, obviously, is a matter of taste and judgment. If one believes, as Killen apparently does, that at least some of what Warhol did pre-1973 was "art," then one will regret what followed. If one believes, as I do, that from day one Warhol fit Samuel Goldwyn's famous malapropism to a tee -- deep down, he was shallow -- then what he did in 1973 and thereafter was merely a continuation of what he'd been doing all along. </p><p>In some respects, 1973 was a good time for American movies, a moment when the studio system went into eclipse and "a brief flowering of director-driven filmmaking" occurred, but movies that seemed adventuresome and exciting then -- "Mean Streets," "The Long Goodbye," "Sleeper," "Don't Look Now," "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" -- don't seem much of either three decades later. Unfortunately for Killen's convenience, the two best and most durable movies of that period -- "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II" -- were released in 1972 and 1974, respectively, underscoring the inescapable truth that trying to pinpoint a single year (or decade) as a "watershed" has its built-in risks. </p><p>Which is to say that while a lot of stuff crested more or less in 1973, it was going on before that year and continued thereafter. My own strongest memory of the gas lines is from 1974, driving from North Carolina to Florida to take a new job and worrying about gas every mile of the way. Watergate certainly was on most people's minds in 1973, but the actual burglary and other capers occurred in 1972, and the climactic events -- the culmination of the Senate hearings, President Nixon's resignation, his pardon by Gerald R. Ford -- took place in 1974. The controversy over school busing to achieve desegregation began well before 1973, and white flight to the suburbs and private academies continued long thereafter. </p><p>This isn't to pick nits with Killen's analyses and arguments, some of which are sound, but to emphasize that history invariably, and successfully, resists pigeonholing. Just as it's almost always fallacious to separate human beings into "generations" -- "the Lost Generation," "the Greatest Generation" -- so it's risky to divide things into decades or, even more narrowly, specific years. A great many young people in the 1920s were far from lost, a lot of people in the 1940s were anything except "great," and a good deal of what Killen tries to squeeze into 1973 actually spread out over a far longer period. Just as much of what we think of as "the '60s" actually occurred in the early or mid-1970s, so much of the controversy and excitement about which Killen writes actually took place over many years. </p><p>Thus the way to read 1973 Nervous Breakdown is to ignore the attempts at pigeon-holing and concentrate on Killen's broader arguments. Two of them strike me as especially sound. One is that, during this time, "American youth was perceived as under assault, alarmingly fragile, in need of increasingly extreme forms of intervention." Killen seizes on Patricia Hearst and the emotions her abduction aroused as emblematic of this, and perhaps he's right: "This story offered itself up to the American public as the consummate account of snapping: a cautionary tale about the radical transformation of the self under the influence of a powerful cult of personality and action." Many young Americans were "vulnerable to strange belief-systems" -- Moonies, Hare Krishnas, extreme fundamentalist Christian groups -- making this a matter of great concern to parents and authorities. The astonishing popularity of the film "The Exorcist," with its nightmares of demonic possession, was evidence of both the fascination and the apprehension that this phenomenon aroused. </p><p>It's also true -- it may be clich� by now, but there's no getting around it -- that this was a time of deep paranoia in this country from which we show little evidence of recovering. The incredible damage that Watergate did to the presidency and to popular confidence in governmental institutions; the loss of Vietnam and the concomitant "sense that the era of Western domination [was] over"; the collapse of the economy and the coming of the OPEC-induced gas lines, still further evidence of the decline of the West -- all of this combined to produce a mood of deep self-doubt, a belief that someone out there was trying to "get" us. </p><p>The repercussions of all this are still with us. Probably not many people read Fear of Flying anymore, and it would be amazing if Gravity's Rainbow is now read anywhere outside of graduate schools or especially self-flagellating book clubs, but the sexual revolution of which Erica Jong's novel was emblematic continues apace, with ever more distressing ramifications, and the paranoia that is at the heart of Thomas Pynchon's brilliant and unreadable novel is still a central characteristic of American culture and politics. </p><p>Nineteen seventy-three is perhaps best seen as part of the '60s. Whether it was a continuation of that period or the day the music died is for the likes of Killen and other cultural commentators to debate, if not decide. In just about every respect, though, it was a lousy year, and good riddance to it. </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

It unfurls on a sweltering August evening in 1909 as Freud disembarks from the steamship George Washington, accompanied by Carl Jung, his rival and prot�g�. Across town, in an opulent apartment high above the city, a stunning young woman is found dangling from a chandelier--whipped, mutilated, and strangled. The next day, a second beauty--a rebellious heiress who scorns both high society and her less adventurous parents--barely escapes the killer. Yet Nora Acton, suffering from hysteria, can recall nothing of her attack. Asked to help her, Dr. Stratham Younger, America's most committed Freudian analyst, calls in his idol, the Master himself, to guide him through the challenges of analyzing this high-spirited young woman whose family past has been as complicated as his own.   &nbsp;   <i>The Interpretation of Murder</i> leads readers from the salons of Gramercy Park, through secret passages, to Chinatown--even far below the currents of the East River where laborers are building the Manhattan Bridge. As Freud fends off a mysterious conspiracy to destroy him, Younger is drawn into an equally thrilling adventure that takes him deep into the subterfuges of the human mind.   &nbsp;   Richly satisfying, elegantly crafted, <i>The Interpretation of Murder</i> marks the debut of a brilliant, spectacularly entertaining new storyteller.</p><p>It has been said that a mystery novel is "about something" and a literary tale is not. <i>The Interpretation of Murder</i> has legitimate claims to both genres. It is most definitely about something, and also replete with allusions to and explications of Shakespeare, to the very beginnings of psychology, to the infighting between psychoanalytic giants--all written in a style that an author with literary aspirations might well envy. <p> In 1909, Drs. Freud and Jung visit Manhattan. They no sooner arrive when a young socialite is murdered, followed by another attempted murder, bearing the same characteristics. In the second case, the victim lives. She has lost her voice and cannot remember anything. The young doctor, Stratham Younger, who has invited Freud to speak at his University, soon involves Dr. Freud in the case. Freud, saying that Nora's case will require a time committment that he does not have, turns her over to Younger. The rudiments of Nora's case are based on Freud's famous Dora, complete with sexual perversions, convoluted twists and turns and downright lies. </p> <p> That is just one of the myriad plot lines in the novel, all of which are intricate, interesting and plausible. All it takes for all of the incidents to be true is a great deal of bad will--and it is abundant here! There are politicians who are less than statesmen, city employees at work for themselves and not the city, doctors who will do anything to undermine Freud's theories, thereby saving the neurotics for themselves, and opportunists at every level of society, seeking psychological or material advantage. Carl Jung is portrayed by turns as secretive, mysterious, odd, and just plain nuts, while Freud remains a gentleman whose worst problem is his bladder. </p> <p> Not the least interesting aspect of the book is all the turn-of-the-century New York lore: bridge building, great mansions, the Astor versus Vanderbilt dustup, immigrant involvement, fabulous entertaining, auto versus carriage. Despite the tangle of tales, debut author Jed Rubenfeld finishes it with writerly dexterity--and the reader is sorry to see it all end. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Currently the Robert R.

It was the ancient and beloved British ballad that anthropomorphically tells the story of how barley was converted into beer. In the Middle Ages, this was not a boutique activity for the idle rich; it was central to survival. We were young and naive, saw it as a book for children, and inexplicably included fairly explicit instructions of how to brew beer in a bathtub. Not surprisingly, the sober review community was not amused. No doubt they envisioned a horde of America&#39;s children starting the fermentation process in their parents&#39; bathtubs. We&#39;re pleased to report that, to the best of our knowledge, this degradation of our national character never occurred and the very youths who were exposed to, and bravely resisted, this temptation are now prime candidates to purchase this new edition. We have seen the error of our ways, and are reissuing this classic, newly hand colored by the artist herself and transformed, much as John Barleycorn was transformed in the story, into an adult title.Mary Azarian grew up on a small farm in Virginia, where<br>she had horses, rabbits and chickens. After graduating from<br>Smith College, where she studied printmaking with Leonard<br>Baskin, she married and moved to a farm in northern Vermont.<br>There she taught for four years in one of the last one-room<br>schoolhouses in the state. A full-time printmaker since 1969,<br>her other books with Godine include A Farmer's Alphabet and<br>Donald Hall's The Man Who Lived Alone. In 1999, she was<br>awarded the Caldecott Medal for Snowflake Bentley.</p><h2>Temporary Agency</h2><p>When I was fourteen, a cousin of mine angered a Malignant One. It was a big case, a genuine scandal. Maybe you remember it. At the time, when it ended, I just wanted to forget about the whole thing. But a couple of years have passed and I guess maybe it's time to think about it again.<br>Thus begins Ellen Pierson's story of how she helped her cousin Paul contend with the Malignant One running a temp agency in the office building where he worked.<br>Ellen's story is a bright and moving tale set in the same fabulous, fantastic America as that of Rachel Pollack's award-winning Unquenchable Fire. Funny and frantic, poignant and powerful, Temporary Agency is an enduring fable from a writer whose work, in the words of Orson Scott Card, "like a river in flood, resists the well-channeled ways, cutting its own channel through the fictional terrain."</p><p>"When I was fourteen, a cousin of mine angered a Malignant One." Ellen Pierson's cousin Paul brings his problem and his fear to Ellen, and Ellen turns to famed investigator Alison Birkett for help. For these two novellas, <b>Temporary Agency</b> and <b>Benign Adjustments</b>, Pollack returns to the Living World. In Unquenchable Fire a character says that "there are only two things in the world. Suffering and ecstasy." Here, Pollack explores this theme in a fast-paced, moving story as Ellen, Paul and Alison unwrap first a conspiracy of evil and then one of misguided good.<p>Allyson Ryan has narrated over eighty audiobooks, among them On the Divinity of Second Chances by Kaya McLaren, for which Allyson received an AudioFile Earphones Award.

Attanasio presents a flamboyant recounting of the myths of Camelot in <i>The Wolf and the Crown</i>, which continues the story of <i>The Dragon and the Unicorn</i> and <i>The Eagle and the Sword</i>. This particular Camelot features a demonic Merlin, Hollow Hills full of tiny faeries "in nightgowns of fog and sticky halos," and a callow High King whose devout prayers to Mary close each of his viewpoint chapters. Attanasio loves the surface flash of words, and <i>The Wolf and the Crown</i> is as dazzling as a jeweled necklace, with occasional flaws, such as references to Brownian motion or "Bunsen blue," that intrude into the concoction of fantasy, mythology, and Arthurian lore. The myths of Camelot, dear to fantasy readers, provide Attanasio with the perfect setting for his intricate lapidary. <i>--Blaise Selby</i>A. A.

Sam finds himself falling away from the world as he grows feathers from his back, while Lilah makes her own subtle and terrifying transformation as she seeks sexual penance under the harsh hand of her boss. Sam and Lilah fall deeper into their separate spiritual paths, and the two hurtle closer and closer to a dark, unknown destiny, one that changes all that they know about life and pain, love and God, and how to find light in the most unforeseen places. Re-examining the traditional roles of priest and prophet, damned and divine, and creating something monstrous and exquisite, this well-crafted novel investigates the so-called truths behind religion and explores the intersection of pleasure and pain.</p></p><p><p><b>Amanda Leduc</b> is a writer who has been published throughout Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdon.&nbsp;She lives in Hamilton, Ontario.</p><p>"A finely tuned exploration into how people live their daily lives when they are heavily invested in the realm of the spiritual."&nbsp; &#x2014;Candace Fertile, <i>Vancouver Sun</i><br><br></p><p>"<i>The Miracles of Ordinary Men</i>&nbsp;is darkly ambitious yet accessible, and mutable, for each reader will come to different conclusions."&nbsp; &#x2014;Heather Cromarty, <i>Globe and Mail </i>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>"At a time when fiction seems soaked in magical realism that is heavy on the magical, Amanda Leduc&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i> The Miracles of Ordinary Men</i> &nbsp;is a pleasant change of pace...The novel is a beautiful read, and Leduc&#x2019;s observations and well placed descriptions lend the magical realism a lyrical quality...<i>The Miracles of Ordinary Men</i> &nbsp;is a strong debut."&nbsp; &#x2014;Angela Hickman, <i>National Post</i><br><br></p><p>"A page turner."&nbsp; &#x2014;Kyla Neufeld, <i>Winnipeg</i><i> Free Press</i><br><br></p><p>"A lyrical, powerful tale of good and evil that explores the nature of free will, faith, and redemption, this debut novel will appeal to fans of magical realism."&nbsp; &#x2014;Lauren Gilbert, <i>Library Journal</i><br><br></p><p>"A haunting novel that is tender and otherworldly."&nbsp; &#x2014;Heather Paulson, <i>Booklist</i><br><br></p><p>"Amanda Leduc's&nbsp;<i>The Miracles of Ordinary Men</i>&nbsp;is fantastic realism, if there is such a thing - well, there is now.

This careful study breaks down these campaigns (and all related operational maneuvers) into 13 map sets or &#x201c;action-sections&#x201d; enriched with 87 original full-page color maps. These spectacular cartographic creations bore down to the regimental and battery level.<br><br>The Maps of the Bristoe Station and Mine Run Campaigns includes the actions at Auburn and Bristoe Station, where Meade&#x2019;s II Corps was nearly trapped and destroyed and the Confederates were caught by surprise and slaughtered; the seminal actions at Rappahannock Station and Kelly&#x2019;s Ford, where portions of Lee&#x2019;s army were surprised and overwhelmed; and the Mine Run Campaign, during which an aggressive Confederate division at the battle of Payne&#x2019;s Farm held back two full Federal corps and changed the course of the entire operation.<br><br>At least one&#x2014;and as many as twelve&#x2014;maps accompany each &#x201c;action-section.&#x201d; Opposite each map is a full facing page of detailed text with footnotes describing the units, personalities, movements, and combat (including quotes from eyewitnesses) depicted on the accompanying map, all of which make the story of these campaigns come alive.<br><br>This original presentation offers readers a step-by-step examination through these long-overlooked but highly instructive campaigns. Coming on the heels of the fiasco that was Lee&#x2019;s Bristoe Station operation, the stunning Union successes at Kelly&#x2019;s Ford and Rappahannock Station demonstrated the weakened state of Lee&#x2019;s Army of Northern Virginia following the debilitating Gettysburg campaign. The Mine Run Operation that followed, with its extensive display of field works and trenches, foreshadowed the bloody fighting that would arrive with the spring weather of 1864 and highlighted once again Meade&#x2019;s methodical approach to battlefield operations that left the authorities in Washington wondering whether he possessed the tenacity to defeat Lee. This detailed coverage is augmented with fascinating explanatory notes. Detailed orders of battle, together with a bibliography and index complete this exciting new volume.<br><br>Perfect for the easy chair or for walking hallowed ground, The Maps of the Bristoe Station and Mine Run Campaigns is a seminal work that, like Gottfried&#x2019;s earlier atlases on Gettysburg, First Bull Run, and Antietam, belongs on the bookshelf of every serious and casual student of the Civil War.</p><p>Dr. Bradley M.

But most of all, we think about family, friends, and the bounty of our country. Edward Bleier&#x2019;s <b>The Thanksgiving Ceremony</b> introduces a brand-new tradition for the Thanksgiving table, offering a wonderful way for all Americans to give thanks and rejoice in the sense of togetherness and community this special holiday brings.<br><br>The heart of the book is a participatory ceremony designed to be read aloud around the table. It recounts the story of the early settlers and the challenges they, and all subsequent immigrant generations, faced. The ceremony provides roles for guests of all ages and takes about twenty minutes. <br><br>There is also a brief history of Thanksgiving, as well as a wide array of poems, hymns, songs, prayers, and readings that enable families to create and customize their own ceremony, including pieces by Maya Angelou, Irving Berlin, Woodie Guthrie, and Emily Dickinson. <br><br>As William Safire writes in his foreword, &#x201c;Getting together for a grand dinner party may be glorious fun, but a holiday should have a focus&#x201d;&#x2014;one that reminds us why we celebrate it.

His story, as presented in his Autobiography and the Life by Eunapius, is supplemented by information from a correspondence of over 1500 items and 64 extant orations. A native of Antioch, he began his teaching career in Constantinople in 340, but soon had to retire to Nicomedeia, where he became acquainted with St. Basil and influential in the development of Julian's paganism. After a second tenure at Constantinople he returned home to become professor in Antioch in 354, a position which he held, through many vicissitudes, for the rest of his life.</p><p>As sophist of Antioch and a devoted exponent of the traditional Hellenic system of education, Libanius remained deliberately and contemptuously unacquainted with Latin, and deplored its growing influence. Naturally humane in outlook and sympathizing with the local bourgeoisie, he criticized bitterly the encroachments and oppressions of the central administration, and the general cruelty of his day. Sincerely pagan in an increasingly aggressive Christian society, he became an influential voice against religious persecution, official or unofficial. The orations on Julian, to whose memory he remained devoted all his life, were composed between 362 and 365, and present Libanius with a congenial subject, revealing him at the height of his powers and influence.</p><p>Also available in the Loeb Classical Library is a two-volume edition of Libanius's <i>Autobiography and Selected Letters</i>.</p></p><p><p>Albert Francis Norman was Professor of Classics at the University of Hull.</p>Norman's command of his material is complete and remarkable.

But when an open-minded professor--the one adult who still believes in the Whangdoodle--joins forces with three children with active imaginations, they become an unstoppable team on a fantastic and sometimes terrifying journey to Whangdoodleland. <p> Readers who have explored Narnia, Oz, or Willy Wonka's chocolate factory will be thrilled at this new destination--a marvelous land that will inspire and stimulate creative and scientific minds. And who better to expose young readers to new ways of seeing, smelling, and hearing than Julie (Andrews) Edwards of <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>The Sound of Music</i> fame? Her lively and clever style pulls readers along effortlessly; she, like the professor, is one grownup who can teach children never to close their minds to possibility. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><p>Julie Andrews Edwards is one of the most recognized figures in the world of entertainment.

The reason for his popularity is not hard to find. Contrary to what many consider to be the contemporary direction of modern poetry, this poet&#39;s work is simple, clear, realistic--almost prose. But the language is as carefully worked as the densest, most surrealistic poetry. In both style and technique, this is poetry descended from Ezra Pound, poetry that is a sibling of Allen Ginsberg&#39;s. Homage to the American Indian marks the first appearance of Ernesto Cardenal&#39;s mature style in English. The open-ended nature of the work reflects its content. The theme is the past, which is also a vision of the future. In the culture of the American Indians, Ernesto Cardenal sees the elements of a more peaceful, humane society, a civilization more nearly in tune with the cycles of the natural world. The poems are not history, although there are events and people in them that are factual. The facts are interpreted by the poet in the light of his own beliefs. The modern world of supply and demand, of war and privilege, must inevitably be superseded by a new order and the new man. For Cardenal, the design of this new order can be perceived in the culture of the Indians. The old world will return to life. Ernesto Cardenal was born in Granada, Nicaragua, in 1925. He took a degree in philosophy and letters in Mexico, did graduate work at Columbia University in New York, and was ordained a Trappist monk in Nicaragua in 1965. Two of his books appear in English: Psalms of Struggle and Liberation (Salmos) and Life In Love, a collection of prose meditations.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Take the Lead: Motivate, Inspire, and Bring Out the Best in Yourself and Everyone Around You</h2><p>&#x201c;Why is it that some people challenge us and motivate us to rise to our best abilities, while others seem to drain our energy and spirit? What is that particular quality certain people have that causes those around them to engage fully and feel connected?&#x201d; <br><br>You are a leader. You do not need to be in a boardroom, on a battlefield, or on a ballot to have a profound impact on everyone around you. In this life-changing book, Betsy Myers&#x2014;senior adviser to two US presidents and former executive director of Harvard&#x2019;s Center for Public Leadership&#x2014;demonstrates how each of us has opportunities to <i>take the lead </i>every day and shares seven core principles that will enable us to be more productive, engaged, and successful. <br><br>From the Oval Office to the playground, cabinet meetings to kitchen tables, in public life and private, Betsy Myers has seen firsthand the emergence of a new leadership model where having all the answers up front is less important than asking the right questions, where strength is derived less from the power you wield than from how you make the people around you feel. <br><br>With personal stories from her time in government, in academia, and on the campaign trail, as well as her experiences as a wife, daughter, and mother, Myers helps all of us learn to set the right priorities for ourselves; to connect on a deeper level with the people around us; to uncover problems early when they are still easy to fix; to collaborate with those whose points of view are different from our own; and to push through our fears and live our most authentic lives. Myers demonstrates that more than simply making people <i>feel </i>good, this kind of leadership can have a profound effect on the results achieved: it is how initiatives are launched, profits are made, and work gets done. <br><br>Personal, practical, and profoundly inspiring, <i>Take the Lead </i>is a book for anyone who wonders where all the great leaders have gone. Betsy Myers helps us see that true leadership is all around us&#x2014;and <i>within </i>us.</p><p>Betsy Myers served as chief operating officer and senior adviser to Barack Obama&#x2019;s 2007&#x2013;2008 presidential campaign and chaired the Women for Obama organization. A senior official in the Clinton administration, she was the first director of the White House Office for Women&#x2019;s Initiatives and Outreach.

Often compared to Leonardo da Vinci and called "the planet's friendly genius," he was the inventor of the geodesic dome, the man who coined the term "spaceship earth," and an educator without parallel. Yet, most of his books are out of print today.<br><br>To remedy this situation, his longtime friend and architectural partner, Thomas Zung, has compiled a Bucky Fuller reader. This anthology consists of chapters selected from twenty of Bucky's many books, each with a new Introduction by such notables as Arthur C. Clarke, Steve Forbes, Calvin Tomkins, Dr. Martin Meyerson, Sir Harold W. Kroto, Arthur L. Loeb, E. J. Applewhite, and others.<br><br>Altogether, this book provides an overview of a remarkable intellectual career and the best possible introduction to the man and his thought. Bucky Fuller was one of the most original thinkers and builders that America has ever produced, and this book makes his work available to a new generation at the beginning of a new millennium.<br></p><p>Great minds most certainly do not all think alike. Case in point: R. Buckminster Fuller, who revolutionized Western thinking and design, even though only a tiny fraction of his ideas were ever developed. Outrageously, most of his works are out of print here at the turn of the century, so his collaborator and architectural partner, Thomas T.K. Zung, organized the publication of <i>Buckminster Fuller: Anthology for the New Millennium</i>. Collected are 20 selections from Fuller's books, each introduced by notable thinkers and writers like Steve Forbes and Arthur C. Clarke. Though Fuller's distinctive style--part engineering text, part poetry--takes a bit of extra attention to penetrate, the rewards are tremendous. Though now clich�d, his concept of Spaceship Earth ("only eight thousand miles in diameter, which is almost a negligible dimension in the great vastness of space") blew more minds than the Beatles' "White Album." Zung's selections are juicy and enticing--few readers will be able to resist a trip to the library after reading morsels of <i>Utopia or Oblivion</i> and <i>Epic Poem on the History of Industrialization</i>. The introductions range from scholarly to personal, and close in on Fuller's work and personality without ever quite reaching them-they, of course, are best revealed in his writing and his still-mimicked work. Those new to this thinker will find the anthology breathtaking, while those in the know will discover much that is new, including his amazing $10 telegram version of the theory of relativity. It's hard to overestimate Fuller's importance to 20th- and 21st-century thought, despite his self-description in his last book: "I am now close to 88 and I am confident that the only thing important about me is that I am an average healthy human." If only he knew. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Thomas Tse Kwai Zung</b> was born in Shanghai, China. He was a student of Buckminster Fuller and, with Fuller's Synergistics, Inc., designed the elongated geodesic dome in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1968. He has worked on various geodesic domes, including the <i>Jitterbug</i> sculpture, Tensegrities, the Fly Eye's dome, and Fuller's last invention, the Hang-It-All.

Derided by critics, sneered at by contemporaries, their work sold for pittances. They were either marginalized or dismissed altogether by the French art establishment. And, to some degree, their iconic works have eclipsed them. <br><br>Portraying them as individuals and as fellow conspirators in a new way of seeing and representing the world, Jeffrey Meyers brings to life this most popular and influential group of painters in the entire history of art. The result is an accessible and wonderfully illuminating book that offers readers a fresh way of looking at these artists and the priceless, timeless masterpieces they created. <br></p><p>JEFFREY MEYERS is the recipient of a Fulbright fellowship and a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, and the author of biographies of Katherine Mansfield, Joseph Conrad, and Somerset Maugham. He lives in the San Francisco Bay area. <br>INDEFINABLE FINESSE <br>1832-1858<br><br>~ EDOUARD MANET, the notorious creator of sexually daring paintings, was beloved by his friends and despised by the critics and the public. In the 1860s, when he began his career, he was handsome, charming and always fashionably dressed in his carefully tailored jacket, light-colored trousers and tall, wide-brimmed hat. Burning to succeed, and sure that he knew the direction painting should go, he worked with models in his studio, met friends in the Louvre and in private galleries, talked art and politics in the Paris salons and caf�s. The crusading novelist Emile Zola, an early defender of his art, noted his "keen, intelligent eyes, [his] restless mouth turning ironic now and again; the whole of his expressive, irregular face has an indefinable finesse and vigor about it." Armand Silvestre, a contemporary critic, described Manet's appealing character and caustic wit. He was "a kind of dandy. Blond, with a sparse, narrow beard which was forked at the end, he had in the extraordinary vivacity of his gaze, in the mocking expression on his lips-his mouth was narrow-lipped, his teeth irregular and uneven-a very strong dose of the Parisian street urchin. Although very generous, and very good-hearted, he was deliberately ironic in conversation, and often cruel. He had a marvelous command of the annihilating and devastating phrase."<br><br> Antonin Proust, his faithful friend since childhood, emphasized Manet's courtly manners. He was of "medium height and muscular build. He had a lithe charm which was enhanced by the elegant swagger of his walk. No matter how much he exaggerated his gait or affected the drawl of the Parisian urchin, he was never in the least vulgar. One was conscious of his breeding." Manet, easily astonished and easily amused, had a character as dazzling as his appearance. Despite his sharp tongue, nervous outbursts and fits of depression, he impressed distinguished friends like Baudelaire and Mallarm�. He told Zola that "he adored society and discovered secret pleasures in the perfumes and brilliant delights of evening parties."1 Th�odore Duret, who met Manet in Madrid in 1865 and became his friend, summed him up as essentially "a man of the world, refined, courteous, polished...fond of frequenting salons, where he was remarked and admired for his verve and his flashing wit."<br><br> The art dealer Ren� Gimpel suggested his physical charm, remembering how the very smoothness of "his beard, well kept, brushed, curled, soft and caressing, [was] almost uniquely suitable for love." The journalist Paul Alexis defined the sensitivity and responsiveness that made so many women fall in love with him. Manet was "one of the five or six men of present-day Parisian society who still know how to talk to a woman. The rest of us...are too bitter, too distracted, too deep in our obsessions: our forced gallantries make us resemble bears dancing the polka."<br><br> One story synthesizes Manet's delightful personality and delicate wit. When a collector bought his Bunch of Asparagus and was so pleased with the painting that he paid an additional 200 francs, Manet painted another still life, of a single asparagus spear, and sent it along with a note that read: "There was one missing from your bunch."2 Manet's social graces and artistic genius attracted many followers. He would need all his courage and self-confidence, all the loyalty and support of family and friends, to face years of official rejection, critical hostility and public neglect.<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>AS A CHILD Edouard showed little sign of the academic talent so prized in France. Intended by his father to be a lawyer, he studied first at the Institut Poiloup and then-from the age of twelve to sixteen-at the Coll�ge Rollin. "'This child is feeble,' the headmaster noted on Edouard's report card, 'but he shows zeal, and we hope he will do well.'" Here he met his future biographer, Antonin Proust, who later described Manet's boredom and misery in that oppressively grim atmosphere. The Coll�ge, at one time a girls' reform school, had become a typically austere school for boys:<br><br>[There was] an ill-lit, prison like room, stinking of smoky lamps in the evening, furnished in the most primitive manner with narrow, rough benches, screwed so close to desks that they crushed your chest. We were packed in there like sardines. There was nothing on the walls, not even a map....<br><br> The only lesson which interested him at college, apart from gymnastics and the drawing lessons which he took from time to time, was history.<br><br>A few years later his reports had marginally improved, from "feeble" to "distracted," "slightly frivolous" and "not very studious." Relying on his own memories, Proust declared that "Edouard was as happy at home as he was unhappy at the Coll�ge Rollin,"3 but this was not true.<br><br> Manet "came from one of those austerely high-minded and pious families," the art critic John Richardson observed, "which traditionally provided the French state with the most eminent of its public servants." They were also, as Baudelaire wrote (with some exaggeration) of his own parents, "idiots or maniacs, in grand apartments, all of them victims of terrible passions." Manet's ancestors had made money, bought land, and established solid positions in the learned professions and in upper-class society. His father Auguste (born in 1797) was a supervisor of personnel in the Ministry of Justice, where he gathered files on prospective judges, and rose rapidly through the administrative ranks to become a judge in the civil court. He sat on the bench with two other judges to hear "cases that included contested wills, paternity suits, legal separations, negligence charges, and copyright violations." On his mother's side Manet had some connections with Napoleonic royalty. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Fournier, a successful merchant in Sweden, had helped Napoleon's marshal Jean Bernadotte to become crown prince and then King Charles XIV of Sweden. Bernadotte became godfather to Manet's mother, Eug�nie D�sir�e, who was born in Gothenburg in 1811 and married Auguste Manet in 1831.<br><br> Auguste's salary and his wife's dowry, his investments and inherited property in Gennevilliers (on the Seine, north of Paris) provided a substantial income and a comfortable home. One critic called Auguste "a man of duty, sternly honest, unflaggingly virtuous. He was enormously self-righteous,"4 and had solidly bourgeois ambitions for his three sons. Edouard, the oldest, was born in Paris on January 23, 1832, followed by his brothers Eug�ne in 1833 and Gustave in 1835. The teenage Manet was unhappy at school and at home, where his father's disappointment in his son caused considerable friction. Fortunately, Edouard's uncle and neighbor, the artillery captain Edmond Fournier, encouraged his nephew's talent for drawing, took him to the Louvre on Sundays and gave him his first informal lessons in the history of art.<br>Copyright � 2005 by Jeffrey Meyers<br><br>All rights reserved.

A Baedeker to the century."--<i>Newsweek</i>.Nearly 100 passionate, often confrontational essays and editorials from the first 80 years of the New Republic. Selected by former managing editor Wickenden (now national affairs editor at Newsweek), the pieces debate such issues as isolationism, Zionism, abortion, and affirmative action. Among the writers represented are Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell, W.H. Auden, and Irving Howe. Originally founded as a ``journal of opinion'' by Walter Lippmann in 1914, the New Republic became identified with American liberalism. Yet a recurrent theme here is the failures of liberalism and the ineptness of liberals, whose lack of pragmatism is repeatedly defined as partly responsible for the horrors of the 20th century. In a 1940 essay, Lewis Mumford states, ``The liberal lacks confidence in himself and in his vision of life.'' Diverging from the Left's often fashionable pastime of Israel-bashing, the magazine has embraced the Zionist cause- -particularly since 1974, when Martin Peretz became editor. Though vaguely critical of the Israelis on occasion, it has depicted the PLO as almost diabolical. In his strong defense of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Peretz writes, ``Confiscations, harassments, young people forced into the militias, schools closed, rapes, molestations...this was the stuff of everyday life in the web of the PLO's `state within a state.' '' Other articles included here have proven prophetic. ``Limits of the New Left,'' written by Christopher Jencks in 1967, foresees a right-wing revival because of the New Left's lack of discipline and inability to organize itself. English teacher Janet Sideman's ``Death of a Dropout,'' also published in 1967, offers a glimpse into American classrooms that value conformity at the price of creativity and remain irrelevant to many of their students' lives. A valuable chronicle of the 20th century's most crucial debates, culled from the pages of one of our most influential periodicals. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is Leverhulme Research Professor of English Literature at the University of Warick. <br> <b>A <i>Booklist </i>Editors' Choice</b>&nbsp;John Clare (1793-1864) is the greatest working-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self, but until now he has never seen the subject of a comprehensive literary biography.&nbsp;Here, at last, is his story, revealed by the light of his voluminous work: his birth in poverty, his work as an agricultural laborer, his burgeoning promise as a writer cultivated under the gaze of rival patrons, his moment of fame in the company of John Keats as the toast of literary London, and finally his decline into mental illness and confinement in asylums. Clare's ringing voice&#x2014;quick-witted, passionate, vulnerable, courageous&#x2014;emerges through generous quotation from his letters, journals, autobiographical writings, and poems, as Jonathan Bate, the celebrated scholar of Shakespeare, brings the complex man, his beloved work, and his ribald world vividly to life. "[An] engrossing volume . . . Bate makes Clare's life as fascinating for us today as it was for Victorians, and his scholarship corrects the mistakes of earlier biographers without clogging the narrative. By surveying a broad selection of his subject's work, he sustains his contention that Clare ought to be considered a major poet. His unaffected diction, blessedly unencumbered by the ornate conventions of his time, sounds contemporary . . . In this groundbreaking biography and the judicious selection of poems [made by Bate] in <i>'I Am'</i>, John Clare's voice carries across the centuries and speaks to us as freshly as the unspoiled nature he loved."&#x2014;<b>Phoebe Pettingell, <i>The New Leader</i></b>&nbsp;"Splendid . . . It is Clare's love of his native countryside that comes through most powerfully in this volume . . . Thanks to Mr. Bate's biography, Clare will no longer be remembered as a mere madman or prodigy, but will be granted his rightful place in the canon as England's pre-eminent poet of nature."&#x2014;<b>Amanda Kolson Hurley, <i>The Washington Times</i></b>&nbsp;"Perceptive."&#x2014;<b>Adam Kirsch, <i>Bookforum</i></b>&nbsp;"Bate's thorough and lively [study] provides a more nuanced view both of Clare's psychological complexity as a person and of the possibilities for artistic and intellectual development available in the milieu of Clare's upbringing than has hitherto been available."&#x2014;<b>Eric Gudas, <i>The Bloomsbury Review</i></b>&nbsp;"One of the challenges for [Clare's] biographer is to establish a living sense of the diverse realms he inhabited as agricultural worker, fashionable poet, foundering literary celebrity, and mental patient. Another is to trace the development of Clare's crystalline poetic vision, which unerringly focused and deepened itself while his beloved Northamptonshire landscape, his financial prospects, his literary status and even, at last, much of his personality, fell apart round him. Jonathan Bate's biography, the first full-scale life to appear since 1932, succeeds splendidly on both counts, not only making generous use of Clare's own wonderful prose and verse but adding historical perspective and a constant, intelligent probing . . . One of the strengths of <i>John Clare: A Biography</i> is its refusal to propose easy answers to any of the questions raised by Clare's life. Bate has an essayist's ability to walk around a problem, interrogating it from various sides . . . Clare's is an extraordinary story, both disturbing and inspiring. Jonathan Bate tells it in considerable detail and this is a big book, with a level of detail and intricacy of argument which demand stamina from the reader. But its seriousness, compassion, and lightness of touch make it highly readable."&#x2014;<b>Grevel Lindop, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b>&nbsp;"Fascinating . . . For more than a century, Clare has been hailed as a victim&#x2014;of an uncultivated upbringing, of ignorant editors, of brutal doctors, even of the demon of poetry itself. The story of the divinely endowed poetic genius martyred by his gift is hard to resist, but Bate undertakes to dispel these notions, revealing the breadth of Clare's knowledge, the purposefulness of his writing style (he wouldn't take criticism, even from Keats), and his reliance on the generosity and intelligence of his editor, John Taylor. Bate's exploration of these myths is as compelling as his debunking of them. He richly describes the social and cultural life in 19th century England, specifically the presentation of Clare's 'peasant poet' persona, the political pressures Clare faced while receiving aid from wealthy aristocratic patrons, and the 19th century understanding and treatment of mental illness, which, to Clare's benefit, had recently undergone a transformation to a more humane form. Since his life seemed to beg for an explanation and his work espoused no ideology or agenda&#x2014;merely the quiet appreciation of the natural world&#x2014;Clare has been a kind of blank slate on which later generations project their own identities. Through scrupulous historical research, at times dizzying in its attention to detail, Bate avoids this pitfall, illuminating rather than obscuring Clare's personality and his poetry. His intimate and definitive account of Clare's life accomplishes more than most biographies could hope to: It gives us plenty of reasons to turn to the poet's verse."&#x2014;<b>Jason Baskin, <i>Newsday</i></b>&nbsp;"An appropriately ample and properly judicious biography. It rises from a passionate conviction in Clare's genius, and spreads into a calm appraisal of his experience. But there's cleverness in this calm: Bate knows the sadness of Clare's story has led previous writers to make false claims, or to agitate the clear spirit of his writing with their own well-meant heat. His own tactic is to take nothing for granted, to stay as close as possible to Clare's own intentions, to resist the temptation to read all the poems as being strictly autobiographical, and to admit ignorance where ignorance exists . . . Bate wisely makes space for a thematic approach, winding chapters on (among other things) heredity, childhood, social environment, and friendship around the hard facts of birth, family, and so on. Far from making Clare seem vague, this has the good effect of allowing him to be in a kind of dream. It's a dream which combines elements of bliss&#x2014;the</p><p><b>John Clare </b>(1793-1864) lived all his life in rural Northamptonshire. He is widely celebrated as one of England's great nature and folk-life writers. <br><br><b>Jonathan Bate</b> is the celebrated author of <i>Shakespeare and Ovid</i> (1993) and <i>The Genius of Shakespeare</i> (1997). He is Leverhulme Research Professor and King Alfred Professor of English at the University of Warwick.<br><p> John Clare (1793-1864), who was born in the village of Helpston, Northamptonshire, in the eastern flatlands of England, found his poetry in the woods and fields, in the intricate nests of birds and the avid renewal of wildflowers, in "a language that is ever green." He was enabled by what he read -- James Thompson's poem "The Seasons" inspired him to become a poet -- and often wandered through the fields with a book jammed in his pocket. "The fields were our church," he later recalled, "and we seemed to feel a religious feeling in our haunts on the sabbath." A secular religious sensibility -- "the quiet love of nature's presence" -- animates his work, early and late.</p><p> Jonathan Bate's capacious and detailed new book, John Clare: A Biography (Farrar Straus Giroux, $40), tells the story of England's greatest working-class poet with deep sympathy and understanding. It is published simultaneously with a splendid selected poems that demonstrates the complete range of Clare's achievement, which is no mean feat since he wrote more than 3,500 poems over a 35-year period. The punctuation is a bit too regularized for my taste -- Clare was a madcap and eccentric punctuator at best -- but the trade-off in literal accuracy does give the poems fuller accessibility to a wider audience. He breathes in these pages.</p><p> Clare was "addicted" to poetry, helpless before his rural muse. He was an agricultural laborer, who published four poetry books during his lifetime, containing less than one-quarter of his total output. He was taken up as a "peasant poet" in London, supported by rival patrons, cultivated, condescended to, neglected. He was dogged by poverty most of his life. He had a keen ear for the vernacular and championed local customs, yet was considered "peculiar" by his neighbors. He stuck out everywhere -- an alien at home, a lonely visionary. He empathized with outsiders, such as gypsies, whom he characterized as "a quiet, pilfering, unprotected race." It is no wonder, then, that shy, vulnerable creatures especially called to him -- the snipe, the marten, the badger, the field-mouse.</p><p> Clare was a prodigious walker, a solitary who sought out the secret recesses of nature, a hidden, underappreciated, overlooked country, which he detailed with a sharp eye and a naturalist's sensibility. Accuracy was a scrupulous habit, a moral imperative. He had a powerful capacity to identify with what he observed. Bate points out that more than 50 of Clare's poems begin "I love." "Poets love nature and themselves are love," he wrote in a late sonnet. "For everything I felt a love,/ The weeds below, the birds above," he declared in "The Progress of Rhyme." Bate also notes that the most common noun in Clare's mature poetry is "joy." One distinguishing feature of Clare's work is the ethic of reciprocity that he brought to his encounters with the natural world.</p><p> Clare's poetry intimately chronicles a world that was rapidly disappearing, that was systematically divided up into rectangular plots of land, fenced off and restricted, enclosed. This gives particular social and political relevance to his highly personal first subject, the lost Eden of childhood, a world that he never forgot but that seemed to abandon him. It also gives additional poignancy to his love poems, which are typically invitations: "Let us go in the fields, love, and see the green tree;/ Let's go in the meadows and hear the wild bee;/ There's plenty of pleasure for you, love, and me/ In the mirth and the music of nature."</p><p>We'll down the green meadow and up the lone glen </p><p>And down the woodside far away from all men, </p><p>And there we'll talk over our love-tales again </p><p> Where last year the nightingale sung.</p><p> He loved to roam so freely through open fields, through wilds and waste places, through uncultivated regions, that it comes as something of a shock to find him suddenly looking back over his shoulder for magistrates and gamekeepers.</p><p> </p><p>I dreaded walking where there was no path </p><p>And pressed with cautious tread the meadow swath </p><p>And always turned to look with wary eye </p><p>And always feared the owner coming by;</p><p>Yet everything about where I had gone </p><p>Appeared so beautiful I ventured on </p><p>And when I gained the road where all are free </p><p>I fancied every stranger frowned at me </p><p>And every kinder look appeared to say </p><p>"You've been on trespass in your walk today."</p><p>I've often thought, the day appeared so fine, </p><p>How beautiful if such a place were mine;</p><p>But, having naught, I never feel alone </p><p>And cannot use another's as my own.</p><p>Clare was alert both to social and economic alienation. E. P. Thompson recognized that "Clare may be described, without hindsight, as a poet of ecological protest: he was not writing about man here and nature there, but lamenting a threatened equilibrium in which both were involved."</p><p>He suffered from a disconcerting number of physical and mental troubles. Bate scrupulously chronicles the tormented years from 1837 to 1864 that the poet spent in the High Beach Asylum and the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum. He suggests that Clare "conforms to the classic pattern . . . of manic depression or 'bipoloar affective disorder,' " though in the end concludes that he was most likely schizophrenic. He had periods of lucidity mixed with bouts of depression and episodes of mania. He was emotionally volatile. He suffered from delusions and obsessively identified himself with Lord Byron. One of his strangest literary performances is "Don Juan: A Poem," which begins, " 'Poets are born' -- and so are whores -- the trade is/ Grown universal."</p><p> Clare was also gripped by the notion that he had two wives. One was his actual wife, the other his youthful crush and early muse, Mary Joyce. "To Mary" begins:</p><p>I sleep with thee and wake with thee </p><p>And yet thou are not there;</p><p>I fill my arms with thoughts of thee </p><p>And press the common air.</p><p>Thy eyes are gazing upon mine </p><p>When thou art out of sight;</p><p>My lips are always touching thine </p><p>At morning, noon and night.</p><p>Clare continued writing all through his asylum years: "I wrote because it pleased me in sorrow," he said, "and when I am happy it makes me more happy and so I go on."</p><p> Some of Clare's finest works were asylum poems: "A Vision," "An Invite to Eternity," a poem addressed to his namesake, and two disconsolate self-revelations that begin "I am," one a sonnet ("I feel I am -- I only know I am"), the other a lyric that stands as his most haunting memorial, a poem with a simple eloquence, a shocking lucidity.</p><p> </p><p>Lines: "I Am"</p><p>I am -- yet what I am, none cares or knows;</p><p>My friends forsake me like a memory lost:</p><p>I am the self-consumer of my woes -- </p><p>They rise and vanish in oblivion's host </p><p>Like shadows in love-frenzied stifled throes -- </p><p>And yet I am and live -- like vapours tossed </p><p>Into the nothingness of scorn and noise, </p><p>Into the living sea of waking dreams </p><p>Where there is neither sense of life or joys </p><p>But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems;</p><p>Even the dearest that I love the best </p><p>Are strange -- nay, rather, stranger than the rest.</p><p>I long for scenes where man hath never trod, </p><p>A place where woman never smiled or wept, </p><p>There to abide with my Creator, God, </p><p>And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept, </p><p>Untroubling and untroubled where I lie, </p><p>The grass below -- above, the vaulted sky.</p><p> </p><p>By Edward Hirsch </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Its subterranean counterminings disclose the roiling demons in the cellar of the human mind, but that is hardly all. Nissenson's art of the future is twinned with the deepest history of imagination, and <i>The Song of the Earth</i> is visionary at its powerful and entirely amazing root.

Dinorella attends the Dinosaur Dance at Duke Dudley's Den, compliments of a Fairydactyl, and comes upon the endangered Duke, about to be devoured by a dastardly deinonychus. Dinorella to the rescue--she hurls a dirtball, then a diamond, at the desperado. The alliteration begins to get away from Edwards, dictating the storyline and resulting in dialogue and descriptions that prove distracting after the first few pages. The story deteriorates further with name-calling: ``dopey domestic,'' ``disgusting dummy,'' ``dimwit,'' ``dingbat,'' and ``dumbhead.'' Cole dazzles in this dumbed-down classic, which goes from hilarious to tedious in very short order. (Picture book. 4-7) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In addition to his philosophical teachings, he offered ideas for the development of many practical activities, including education, agriculture, medicine, economics, architecture, science, religion, and the arts. <br><br> Steiner&#x2019;s original contribution to human knowledge was based on his ability to conduct &#x201c;spiritual research,&#x201d; the investigation of metaphysical dimensions of existence. With his scientific and philosophical training, he brought a new systematic discipline to the field, allowing for conscious methods and comprehensive results. A natural seer from childhood, he cultivated his spiritual vision to a high degree, enabling him to speak with authority on previously veiled mysteries of life. <br><br> This introductory reader collects excerpts from Steiner&#x2019;s many talks and writings on the significance of Christmas.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

A pinup asks you to suspend interest in who the person is and occupy yourself entirely with looking at the body, fantasizing about what you could do with that body, completely ignoring how the person might feel about it. People who make pinup photographs don't care who the woman is, what tragedies or triumphs that person's life might encompass. My work hopefully works exactly counter to that. My ambition is that you look at the pictures and realize what complex, fascinating, interesting people every single one of my subjects is. --Jock Sturges, the Boston Phoenix<br><br>Long known for his radiant black-and-white naturist portraiture, Jock Sturges has also been quietly working in color for more than two decades. Life Time presents a broad range of this color work for the first time and carries forward Sturges' extended portraits of families in Northern California counter-culture communities and on French naturist beaches. Working with the same models and their families in his long-term studies of growth, change and relationship, his large format images borrow significantly from classical periods in both photography and nineteenth and early twentieth century painting. The large color plates in Life Time represent almost perfect one to one translations of the original transparencies and are rich with detail and physical and psychological nuance. Sturges describes his work as "identity driven" because his portraits represent collaborations that stretch over entire lifetimes. The confident ease with which all of his subjects present themselves to his camera evidences a rare level of trust and friendship.</p><p></p><h2>A Thousand Miles of Dreams: The Journeys of Two Chinese Sisters (Asian Voices)</h2><p>*For the bibliography mentioned in the book, click here.<br><br>A Thousand Miles of Dreams is an evocative and intimate biography of two Chinese sisters who took very different paths in their quests to be independent women. Ling Shuhao arrived in Cleveland in 1925 to study medicine in the middle of a U.S. crackdown on Chinese immigrant communities, and her effort to assimilate began. She became an American named Amy, while her sister Ling Shuhua burst onto the Beijing literary scene as a writer of short fiction. Shuhua's tumultuous affair with Virginia Woolf's nephew during his years in China eventually drew her into the orbit of the Bloomsbury group. The sisters were Chinese "modern girls" who sought to forge their own way in an era of social revolution that unsettled relations between men and women and among nations. Daughters of an imperial scholar-official and a concubine, they followed trajectories unimaginable to their parents' generation.<br><br>Biographer Sasha Su-Ling Welland stumbled across their remarkable stories while recording her grandmother's oral history. She discovered the secret Amy had jealously hidden from family in the United States&#x2014;her sister's fame as a Chinese woman writer&#x2014;as well as intriguing discrepancies between the sisters' versions of the past. Shaped by the social history of their day, the journeys of these extraordinary women spanned the twentieth century and three continents in a saga of East-West cultural exchange and personal struggle.<br><br>Visit the author's website for more information and upcoming events. http://www.sashawelland.com/index.html</p><p><b>Sasha Su-Ling Welland</b> has woven together the remarkable lives of her grandmother and great-aunt in this biography.

She's arranged a romantic getaway for the two of them at a lovely beach cottage on Dauphin Island off the Gulf Coast. On the first day of their island adventure, they take a historical tour led by Angela Trotter, a young woman well-versed in local lore, including rumors of pirate treasure hidden somewhere on the island. In fact, Angela confides to Sarah Booth and Graf that her father, a sailor and treasure hunter, was murdered just when he thought he was closing in on the treasure. Angela's convinced that the wrong man was imprisoned for her father's murder, and she manages to persuade Sarah Booth to take the case. And Sarah Booth soon realizes that there's much more going on than meets the eye.

The waves crest inches from my bare feet, a rhythmic tidal pull that comforts me, promising that life continues. The end of an October day is nothing less than stunning on the small barrier island named for French royalty: Dauphin Island, Alabama.</p> <p>Graf Milieu, my fianc�, is in the beach cottage I&#x2019;ve rented for a week. My hope is that Graf will find walking in the sand good therapy for his gun-shot leg and the island&#x2019;s beauty healing to his injured spirit. Graf&#x2019;s wounds go much deeper than a shattered bone, and they are my fault. He was abducted, shot, and held prisoner without medical care because my private investigative work spilled over into his life.</p> <p>But that is the past and cannot be changed, no matter how hard I wish it. What I&#x2019;m planning with this Gulf Coast getaway is to protect the future.</p> <p>Sweetie Pie, my loyal hound, roots her nose into the back of my armpit, letting me know she sympathizes with my worry. My dog and Pluto, the black cat who lives with us at Dahlia House, my ancestral Mississippi Delta home, are here with me at the beach to aid in Graf&#x2019;s recuperation. I need all the help I can get.</p> <p>The wind is chilly off the water, and my butt is damp from sitting in the sand. Pluto struggles toward me, his dainty little paws sinking with each step. With a kitty sigh, he plops into my lap. He has only contempt for the surf and for anyone who admires water&#x2014;even the dazzling aqua waves of the Gulf of Mexico. Water is necessary for fish, and that&#x2019;s as far as Pluto is willing to go.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Graf?&#x201d; I ask the critters, hoping he is not far behind them.</p> <p>They both look back toward the beach cottage. Sweetie&#x2019;s long, delicate ears droop more than usual. The critters are worried about Graf, too. He&#x2019;s been in a terrible state since he was shot. The surgery to repair the bone was successful, but the recovery has been painful. The doctors saved his leg, but there is a chance he will always limp. Graf is an actor with a good chance of becoming a movie star. Physical disabilities don&#x2019;t fit into that equation. He&#x2019;s fighting hard against the anger, fear, and depression that are normal emotions accompanying such an injury.</p> <p>And have I mentioned this is all my fault?</p> <p>The wind whips off the water and sends a salty spray into my face, and for a moment I remember this same beach some twenty-five years earlier, when I vacationed here with my parents. The beach cottages were much plainer, less luxurious, and no oil-drilling rigs dotted the horizon. The sand was pristine then and hadn&#x2019;t suffered the thousands of gallons of oil from BP&#x2019;s Deep Water Horizon well that blew and polluted the Gulf. My parents were alive, and I was safe, expecting only the best of a bright future. Life has certainly taken me down a peg or six.</p> <p>Sweetie&#x2019;s cold nose against my armpit brings me back from those carefree childhood days. The sun has dropped below the horizon, and the skyline to the east is swiftly changing from peacock-blue to indigo. Time to gird my loins and do battle against Graf&#x2019;s worries. I shall bring joy back to his life. I shall do it with my bare intention and will.</p> <p>I stand up suddenly, just in time to catch the image of a woman clad in widow&#x2019;s weeds on the other side of the sand dune. She is there one moment and gone the next. Sweetie sees her, too, as does Pluto, who puts on his Halloween arch. Like most felines, Pluto disdains unexpected company.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who was that?&#x201d; I asked, even as I loped over the sand in pursuit of the strange figure.</p> <p>When I rounded the dune, the light was fleeing the sky, but I could make out the feminine silhouette. Her antebellum dress grazed the sand and belled out behind her as the Gulf wind struck the skirt. A black veil floated like the banner of a dark empire. What the hell was going on?</p> <p>Sweetie passed me and gave chase, but she wasn&#x2019;t baying like she would if she was on a scent. Pluto, too, for all of his heft and waddling belly, outdistanced me. The phantom floated across the deep sand while I floundered.</p> <p>&#x201c;You! Wait up!&#x201d; I called. No one&#x2014;not dog, cat, or woman&#x2014;slowed his pace. I notched it up to a full-fledged run. &#x201c;Hey! Stop, dammit!&#x201d;</p> <p>The stranger slowed and confronted me. Her gown and veil popped in the gusting air, and I was reminded of Deborah Kerr in the <i>The Innocents,</i> the film adaptation of &#x201c;The Turn of the Screw.&#x201d; Brilliant and terrifying.</p> <p>The figure seemed to wait for me, and I thought of death. I&#x2019;d always expected the Grim Reaper to be male, but this black-clad raven of gloom persuaded me otherwise.</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; I slowed to a stop in the deep sand two dozen yards from her. She was slender with perfect posture, but her features were obscured by the mourning attire.</p> <p>She said nothing.</p> <p>Sweetie and Pluto were frozen in place only a few feet in front of me. They made not a sound.</p> <p>If this was death come to lurk around the shadows of my life, she would not find hospitality. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve taken too much from me. Get away from here. You have no business with me or the people and animals I love. Be gone!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost, too,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;More than anyone should.&#x201d;</p> <p>In the softness of her voice and the plaintive tone, I realized this was no threat, but someone who knew suffering. &#x201c;What are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A friend.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A widow from the distant past?&#x201d; Judging from the dress style, I&#x2019;d estimate the mid-1800s. It took me a moment, but then I knew. &#x201c;Jitty?&#x201d;</p> <p>She lifted the veil, and I saw sorrow etched in her mocha skin.</p> <p>&#x201c;Funeral crepe? That&#x2019;s the best you could do for a beach costume? No polka-dot bikini? No tawdry flip-flops and big hat? Miss Fashion Plate, where is your style?&#x201d; I vacillated between relief and annoyance. &#x201c;You scared the life out of me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a haint. That&#x2019;s what haints do&#x2014;we frighten people.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re <i>my</i> haint, and upsetting me is not allowed. You live by the rules of the Great Beyond, but I live by Delaney rules, and I just wrote that one.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her chuckle seemed to hold the fading sunlight for a moment longer.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why are you here, Jitty, dressed like a mourner from the eighteen hundreds?&#x201d; My momentary humor was gone, and worry returned.</p> <p>&#x201c;Life is a cycle, Sarah Booth. You know this.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I do. I don&#x2019;t like it, but I know it. I&#x2019;m in the summer of life, and so is Graf. There&#x2019;s no cycle crap happening here that needs widow&#x2019;s weeds.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Perhaps not.&#x201d; She made no promises. It was against the rules of the Great Beyond for her to tell me anything about the future. &#x201c;But remember the wheel of life turns again and again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re warning me Graf is in some new danger, just spit it out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The French call orgasm &#x2018;the little death.&#x2019;&#x201d; Her smile was luminous. And still sad. &#x201c;At the peak of joy is always the descent into death.&#x201d;</p> <p>Too bad there was only sand around. Had there been rocks, I would have picked one up and thrown it at her. &#x201c;Say it plain.&#x201d;</p> <p>She shook her head. &#x201c;So much history has happened on this island beach. The French settled here and named it Massacre Island because their first discovery was a mound created from human bones. It was a Native American burial site.&#x201d; She looked out toward the water, and the last lingering bits of peachy light played across her face. &#x201c;Not a bad place to meet an end.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And not a good place either. Who are you mourning here? Coker died in the war, not on a barrier island.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Very true. My husband died on a blood-soaked battlefield with Alice&#x2019;s husband, your great-great-great-grandfather. But there&#x2019;s history here on Dauphin Island, Sarah Booth. Important history. I suspect you&#x2019;ll find out soon enough.&#x201d;</p> <p>She flickered in and out, as was her wont when she was ready to take a powder.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jitty, will Graf be okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>But there was only the sound of the surf and the wind whipping my shirt like a tattered flag. Sweetie, Pluto, and I turned toward the three-story cottage. A light bloomed in an upstairs window, a smudge of cheer against the star-spangled night.</p> <p>It was time to make dinner for Graf. I had a plan to enliven his spirits. A secret plan. And it would work, because I had no other alternative.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>I took the stairs to the second floor. All of the beach cottages were built on pilings, a precaution against a tidal surge, but it also gave us a primo view of the Gulf. I found Graf on the balcony, leaning on the railing and staring out at the wind-whipped water.</p> <p>I poured glasses of red wine and took them outside. I handed him a glass and then snaked my arm around his waist. He&#x2019;d lost weight, and he didn&#x2019;t need to.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Sarah Booth. You&#x2019;ve been a perfect Florence Nightingale.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Florence Nightingale died a single woman. Not going to be my fate, Graf Milieu. Just giving you a heads-up.&#x201d;</p> <p>The long drive and then the lengthy walk on the beach had tired him. I traced the lines in his face with gentle fingertips as he spoke. &#x201c;Once I&#x2019;m healed, I promise, I&#x2019;ll make an honest woman of you.&#x201d; He drew me close and kissed me with lingering tenderness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting stronger each day. Walking on the beach and climbing the stairs at the cottage&#x2014;exactly what the doctor ordered. Thank you for convincing me to come here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am your Gale Storm with full attention to social and recreational activities, and never forget it.&#x201d; I tiptoed and kissed his chin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve booked a tour of the old fort for tomorrow. This place has a fascinating history. Native Americans, French, Spanish, British, Confederacy, and United States. This area has been ruled by a number of different nations.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You take the fort tour and I&#x2019;ll work out on the beach.&#x201d; Graf sipped his wine and gazed at the crashing surf. The wind ruffled his dark hair. He needed a haircut and a shave. He&#x2019;d come so close to dying, and he&#x2019;d fought so bravely to regain the use of his leg. Sometimes, though, depression snuck up on him. Doc Sawyer had warned me to be on the lookout and to keep him distracted.</p> <p>&#x201c;Aarrgh! Disobey me and ye&#x2019;ll walk the gangplank!&#x201d; I used my finger to poke him in the ribs like a sword.</p> <p>&#x201c;Am I going to have to endure pirate parodies for the whole week?&#x201d; he said teasingly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe. I discovered the Gulf waters were swarming with pirates and buccaneers. And the fort here, Fort Gaines, played a vital role in the War Between the States. Also in the two world wars.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I never realized you were such a history buff, Sarah Booth. I always viewed you as a girl of the moment. All flash and dazzle and heat. Some very interesting heat.&#x201d;</p> <p>My heart surged with hope. Since the gunshot, Graf had avoided intimacy. I&#x2019;d seen him staring at the nasty wound on his leg and now the glaring scar. He was no longer physical perfection. I didn&#x2019;t care, but he did. I had to play this cool. &#x201c;Wars don&#x2019;t interest me a lot. But pirates&#x2014;now that&#x2019;s another story. I love pirate tales. Especially stories involving treasures.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shiver me timbers.&#x201d; Graf swept me backward, bending me over his arm as he held me and rasped his beard along my cheek and neck.</p> <p>I tried to push him away, but he was too strong. &#x201c;What does that even mean? You&#x2019;ve been watching bad pirate movies. Next thing I know, you&#x2019;ll have an eye patch.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And maybe a parrot.&#x201d; He drew me to my feet with ease. &#x201c;Actually, I know a little about sailing. The phrase comes from the ship pounding up and down in rough seas or battle. The concussion would rattle the mast, which was made of wood.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I may have to reconsider my engagement.&#x201d; I held out my left hand with the beautiful diamond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I want to marry a know-it-all.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No danger of that. But I can read. Maybe you should give it a try.&#x201d;</p> <p>I punched his arm lightly. &#x201c;Oh, I brought some books for the beach. I intend to enjoy the surf and an adventure while you complete your physical therapy. I can watch and make sure you&#x2019;re doing it right.&#x201d;</p> <p>Before I&#x2019;d packed to come to Dauphin Island, I&#x2019;d met Doc Sawyer, my friend and family doctor, at Millie&#x2019;s Caf� for a cup of coffee and a chat. I needed his professional advice on dealing with Graf&#x2019;s emotional and physical wounds.</p> <p>&#x201c;Graf has to find his way, Sarah Booth. It isn&#x2019;t just the shattered bone and the pain. This injury has changed how he sees himself. It&#x2019;s shaken loose everything he ever believed about his life and his future.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have to help him.&#x201d;</p> <p>Doc took my hand and gave it a hard squeeze. &#x201c;Be there. Be strong. Supportive. Caring. But don&#x2019;t make the mistake of pandering to him or trying to make this easier. He&#x2019;ll resent you, and he&#x2019;ll hate himself because you pity him. Don&#x2019;t coddle him and for God&#x2019;s sake don&#x2019;t let him act like a tyrant.&#x201d;</p> <p>I clung to those words as I inhaled the salty air and gripped the railing of the balcony. &#x201c;I brought some cards. Care for a few hands of poker?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;In a little while. I&#x2019;m happy here, listening to the surf. To be honest, I&#x2019;m tired. I never thought learning to walk could be so exhausting. How do babies do it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know any better,&#x201d; I said, kissing him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the salad together. We can eat when you&#x2019;re ready. No rush.&#x201d; I picked up his empty glass and left him in the night and wind.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sarah Booth?&#x201d;</p> <p>I turned slowly, trying to disguise the hope I felt. Would he suggest an appetizer before dinner? &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I love the way you help me. You don&#x2019;t have to, though. I don&#x2019;t blame you for what happened.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I blame me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Stop it.&#x201d; He spoke gently. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m healing, and you have to do the same. If you continue to blame yourself, this will always be between us. No one could have predicted what Gertrude would do. It wasn&#x2019;t your fault.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right now, let&#x2019;s focus on getting you back one hundred percent. After that, I&#x2019;ll work on my guilt issues.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a deal.&#x201d; He blew me a kiss. &#x201c;Just remember, I love you.&#x201d;</p> <p>I took that tiny grain of joy and savored it as I went to the kitchen and threw together a curried shrimp salad, one of his favorites.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Sunday dawned with a mantle of lavender and gold. October was closing out, and the beach&#x2014;normally filled with tourists and surf lovers&#x2014;was empty in the chill morning. Graf had fallen asleep on the sofa, and I had left him there. It hurt me that he hadn&#x2019;t come to share my bed, but Cece had given me a primer on the subject.</p> <p>Cece Dee Falcon, my friend, knew more about body image than most psychologists. She&#x2019;d once been Cecil. Only her strong will and intense self-knowledge had given her the strength to fight family and often her community in a quest to become the person she was meant to be.</p> <p>&#x201c;Graf feels diminished,&#x201d; Cece had warned me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t push intimacy. He has to see himself as sexually desirable before he engages. Let him come to you, Sarah Booth. And don&#x2019;t take it personally. This isn&#x2019;t about you. It&#x2019;s all about him.&#x201d;</p> <p>So I tiptoed past him with Sweetie and Pluto following, and we went out on the sand so I could smoke a cigarette. I didn&#x2019;t do it often&#x2014;had in fact fought and beaten the demon tobacco for years. Now I was cutting myself a little slack. Graf and I would both recover our strength and put this behind us, including the smokes.</p> <p>A child&#x2019;s laughter caught Sweetie&#x2019;s attention, and she bounded over the sand dunes and disappeared. She was a gentle dog, but I didn&#x2019;t want her size to intimidate a kid. I stood up and followed with a disgruntled Pluto at my side. The cat was not a fan of early mornings either.

Their daily experiences at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue taught them valuable lessons about how to work productively with people from different walks of life and points of view. These Washington insiders share what they&#x2019;ve learned through first person examples of their own glamorous (and sometimes harrowing) moments with celebrities, foreign leaders and that most unpredictable of animals&#x2014;the American politician.<br> <br>This book is for you if you feel unsure of yourself in social settings, if you&#x2019;d like to get along more easily with others, or if you want to break through to a new level of cooperation with your boss and coworkers. They give specific advice for how to exude confidence even when you don&#x2019;t feel it, ways to establish your reputation as an individual whom people like, trust, and want to help, and lay out the specific social skills still essential to success - despite our increasingly digitized world. Jeremy and Lea prove that social skills are learned behavior that anyone can acquire, and tell the stories of their own unlikely paths to becoming the social arbiters of the White House, while providing tantalizing insights into the character of the first ladies and presidents they served.<br> <br>This is not a book about old school etiquette; they explain the things we all want to know, like how to walk into a roomful of strangers and make friends, what to do about a difficult colleague who makes you dread coming to work each day, and how to navigate the sometimes-treacherous waters of social media in a special chapter on &#x201c;Virtual Manners.&#x201d; For lovers of White House history, this is a treasure of never-before-published anecdotes from the authors and their fellow former social secretaries as they describe pearl-clutching moments with presidents and first ladies dating back to the Johnson administration.<br> <br>The authors make a case for the importance of a return to treating people well in American political life, maintaining that democracy cannot be sustained without public civility.<br> <br><i>Foreword by Laura Bush</i></p><p><p> Lea Berman served as White House Social Secretary from 2004&#x2013;2007, was Chief of Staff to Second Lady Lynne Cheney from 2002&#x2013;2003 and, previously, Social Secretary to the Vice President. She is the creator of the blog America&#x2019;s Table, and lives in Washington, DC. </p> <p> Jeremy Bernard served as White House Social Secretary and Special Assistant to the President from 2011&#x2013;2015. Previously, he was Senior Advisor to the United States Ambassador in France. Prior to that he was the White House Liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).

The resulting chronicle was hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as "the best reporting that the period of depression has brought forth in the United States," and forms the heart of the present volume. In prose that is by turns dramatic and naturalistic, inflammatory and evocative, satirical and droll, Wilson painted an unforgettable portrait of a time when "the whole structure of American society seemed actually to be going to pieces." <i>The American Earthquake</i> bookends this chronicle with a collection of Wilson's non-literary articles-including criticism, reportage, and some fiction-from the years of "The Follies," 1923-1928, and the dawn of the New Deal, 1932-1934. During this period, Wilson had grown from a little-known journalist to one of the most important American literary and social critics of the century. <i>The American Earthquake</i> amply conveys the astonishing breadth of Wilson's talent, provides an unparalleled vision of one of the most troubling periods in American history, and, perhaps inadvertently, offers a self-portrait comparable to <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i>.</p><p><b>Edmund Wilson</b> (1895-1972) was a novelist, memoirist, playwright, journalist, poet, and editor but it is as a literary critic that he is most highly regarded.This collection of nonliterary essays show Wilson "at the peak of his powers as a critic, reporter, and caustic wit," said LJ's reviewer. "These samples of brilliant journalism and satirical observation run the gamut from the Ziegfeld Follies to the depths of the Depression, the New Deal, and the case of the Scottsboro Negro boys" (LJ 3/1/58).

Reprint.</p><p></p><h2>Mountains of the Coast: Photographs of Remote Corners of the Coast Mountains</h2><p>Along British Columbia's western edge from the Alaska panhandle to Vancouver stretches a vast alpine wilderness that ranks as one of the largest and least known on earth. Hidden in the mists beyond the heads of long, dark inlets, this sea of mountains is so isolated that hundreds of major peaks remain unnamed and much of the territory was unexplored until the closing decades of the twentieth century. Vancouver mountaineer John Baldwin, often teamed with his fellow climber John Clarke, has spent twenty-five years exploring and photographing this measureless wilderness, registering an incredible 250-plus first ascents and pioneering some epic ski traverses in the process. <br><br>Together, Baldwin, Clarke and their teams have carried out a program of dicovery that has few parallels in the history of mountaineering, and <i>Mountains of the Coast</i> allows the public to share the high points of their astounding experience for the first time.<br><br>Here are accounts of sudden blizzards, rumbling glaciers and month-long ski traverses over crevasse-mined icefields, side by side with peaceful scenes of alpine flowers and unexpected encounters with mountain goats and grizzly bears. <br>Baldwin describes the careful planning that goes into each expedition, the special freindships that develop among dedicated climbers, and the thrill of being the first human beings ever to set foot on a remote mountain peak. <br><br>Most memorable, <i>Mountains of the Coast</i> unveils the severe beauty of these wild places, revealing page after page of unimaginably spectacular landscapes, many of which have never before been recorded on film. <i>Mountains of the Coast</i> is a breathtaking journey into an unknown world that will appeal to mountain climbers, outdoor enthusiasts and armchair explorers alike.</p><p><p>John Baldwin grew up in Vancouver and became fascinated by the Coast Mountains that rise above the city. Over the past forty years he has completed numerous first ascents and pioneered many remote long ski traverses. He is the author of <em>Mountains of the Coast</em> (Harbour, 1999) and his award-winning photographs have appeared in numerous publications.</p>On long trips in remote areas it is extremely important to be cautious at all times. This is a lesson I learned early in my climbing career - the hard way, unfortunately - during a hike up Hudson Bay Mountain above Smithers in 1977. A group of us had climbed up through the meadows from the ski area to gain the last ridge leading along to the summit. It was early in the summer, with the usual unsettled weather, and we walked on snow between the ridge crest and a huge cornice that hung out over the large cliffs on the east side of the mountain. At a flat point on the ridge it was my turn to lead and break trail for a while, but as I moved ahead the snow fractured and the entire area under my feet dropped like a trap door and sent me hurtling down the cliffs inside an avalanche of snow. The snow pounded and pummelled me in darkness until miraculously, at the bottom of the cliff, I was spewed out onto the glacier amidst piles of debris. I had injured my knee and sustained considerable internal bruising but otherwise I was unscathed. Incredulously I peered back up to the ridge crest 250 metres above, thankful to be alive.<br><br>Sometimes the route is obvious and at other times it remains mysteriously hidden, only to be discovered at the last minute. Every so often a maze of crevasses or a narrow ridge must be negotiated, but mostly there is a tremendous amount of up and down as we make our way through the alpine, climbing the steep sides of mountain after mountain. Often horizontal distances lose their significance and vertical relief becomes the governing measure of how far away a mountain is.<br><br>There is always a slow period after lunch, especially on a hot day, while we digest our food and absorb enough water to renew our bodies after vigorous sweating. But it is a wonderful feeling when after a few minutes of climbing all that tiredness drops away and you fly up the hill with your lungs breathing free and easy. Gaining substantial elevation with a heavy pack is a strenuous but harmless pastime that is completely free of any of the hassles and traps that so often interrupt the normal flow of things. Indeed, there is a kind of sweaty ease that is broken only by the regular, sometimes frantic, expansion and contraction of one's lungs and the rhythmic swish of first the right and then the left boot as they find purchase in the soft summer corn snow.<br><br>We make side trips to the tops of the mountains along our route. Many of these are unclimbed and we build a cairn to celebrate the first ascent. Most are non-technical rounded horns that require scrambling on steep rock or snow rather than any difficult roped climbing. At a time when modern climbers are completing difficult alpine-style ascents of the world's highest mountains, there is no question that these summits fall outside the mainstream of modern mountaineering. Most climbers despair at the amount of walking and lack of technical climbing involved in reaching the summits of these coastal peaks. The general sentiment is that they are not important or worth climbing, and this is the main reason they are left behind. In a sense these climbers are right- there is no glory in conquering hundreds of "little" mountains - but it is a lot of fun. These little peaks were the driving force behind the weeks, months and years we spent tramping through thousands of square kilometres of mountains, allowing us to discover the incredible beauty of a seldom visited part of the earth. (<i>Excerpt</i>)</p><h2>Ronald Searle&#39;s America</h2><p>Dispatched to America in the early &#x2019;60s, the golden age of illustrative reportage, Ronald Searle spent several years covering everything&#x2015;in the form of drawings in his trademark satirical and virtuosic style&#x2015;from sports to politics, for magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post and TV Guide. Topics included Palm Springs, Las Vegas, the Presidential contest between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon&#x2015;as seen through the eyes of a caustic Englishman.</p><p><p><strong>Ronald Searle</strong> (1920-2011) trained at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology (now Anglia Ruskin University) for two years before enlisting in the Royal Engineers in 1939. A prisoner of war from 1942-1945 in Singapore and Thailand, he cartooned during his internment. Searle&#x2019;s best-known comics series consisted of six books published between 1948-1959, featuring juvenile delinquent schoolgirls at the fictional school St. Trinian&#x2019;s. (These have been adapted into films as recently as 2011.) Appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2004, he was also decorated with France&#x2019;s highest honor for an artist, the French Order of the Legion of Honor, won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award, and received the German Order of Merit.</p><p><strong>Matt Jones</strong> is a story artist at Pixar. His Perpetua: Ronald Searle Tribute website has become the foremost resource for Searle fans.</p>&#x201c;This impressive coffee table sized publication breaks down Searle&#x2019;s travels into various locations (and political campaigns by Kennedy and Nixon), showing work that has rarely been seen since original publication in the 1960&#x2019;s, with fascinating on site drawing, rough sketches which reveal the workings behind a joke, plus the richly detailed final images in line and colour. Stylishly designed, it&#x2019;s a treat for all who love drawing (and being entertained &#x2013; several drawings had me laughing out loud), offering an insight into Searle&#x2019;s modus operandi and the effort that went into these assignments.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Association of Illustrators</em></strong></p><h2>The Innocents</h2><p>The Innocents</p><p></p><h2>Discoveries: Petra: Lost City of the Ancient World (Discoveries Series)</h2><p>This rich narrative history surveys the art, culture, and stunning architecture of the ancient city of Petra, whose hidden monuments are carved out of Jordan&#39;s rocky cliffs, and whose rare beauty steadily draws tourists to this remote site in the Arabian desert. 125 illustrations, 108 in full color, 5 x 7&#34;</p><p></p><h2>In the Steps of the Apostle Paul</h2><p>A full-color guide to the cities and countries where Paul preached and first-century Christianity took root.

Here, Richard Wetzell presents the first history of German criminology from Imperial Germany through the Weimar Republic to the end of the Third Reich, a period that provided a unique test case for the perils associated with biological explanations of crime.<br><br>Drawing on a wealth of primary sources from criminological, legal, and psychiatric literature, Wetzell shows that German biomedical research on crime predominated over sociological research and thus contributed to the rise of the eugenics movement and the eventual targeting of criminals for eugenic measures by the Nazi regime. However, he also demonstrates that the development of German criminology was characterized by a constant tension between the criminologists' hereditarian biases and an increasing methodological sophistication that prevented many of them from endorsing the crude genetic determinism and racism that characterized so much of Hitler's regime. As a result, proposals for the sterilization of criminals remained highly controversial during the Nazi years, suggesting that Nazi biological politics left more room for contention than has often been assumed.<br><br></p><p>"Wetzell has added to this new historical literature on particular realms of German life under Nazism with a book that investigates the history of the discipline of criminology from the late nineteenth century to the end of World War II. . . . Wetzell's book is solidly researched and clearly organized and written."-- <i>American Historical Review</i> <br>The first history of German criminology from Imperial Germany through the Third Reich. Exploring the interaction between law, social science, and medicine, Richard Wetzell reveals a constant tension between the criminologists&#39; hereditarian biases and an increasing methodological sophistication that prevented many of them from endorsing the crude genetic determinism and racism of Hitler&#39;s regime.</p><h2>Bound for Canaan (Standing on the Promises, Book 2)</h2><p>The second novel in a trilogy of historical fiction about black Mormon pioneers. The first book followed a few of the black converts who knew Joseph Smith personally, including Elijah Abel, who received the priesthood with Smith&#39;s knowledge and approval, and Jane Manning James, who lived as a family member in the Smith home. The second novel picks up their story for the Mormon trek west to the Salt Lake Valley under Brigham Young&#39;s leadership, and also chronicles the Civil War and the growing emigrations to California. The novel succeeds not only in opening a door on the early black Mormon experience; it also places that experience within the larger context of national race relations. Readers will get refresher courses on Dred Scott, Civil War politics, slave auctions, lynch mobs, blackface minstrelsy and more. One of the Mormon authors (Gray) is African-American, and his own ancestors figure in the novels. The story seems driven more by the historical record than by the need for a smooth plot, as evidenced by the detailed historical notes at the end of every chapter. Although these may distract readers seeking easy escapist fiction, they lend the novel weight and credibility. Given how little is known of early black converts to Mormonism and of their experiences living in Utah, this trilogy is a treasure. It is a badly needed history lesson coated with a layer of imagination a combination that has proved enormously popular in the works of Gerald Lund.</p><p>Just in time for Black History Month comes this second novel in a trilogy of historical fiction about black Mormon pioneers.

His ship has the capability and fuel to jump 300,000 parsecs in two jumps of 150,000 parsecs each, but God asks him to accept an assignment 900,000 parsecs away, in the heart of enemy territory on the belief that miracles can happen:</p><p> </p><blockquote>"You answered without reflection. This time I want you to reflect, Captain Chance. Do you believe in miracles?"<p> Mack reflected, tussling with successive layers deceptively labeled "soul," "core," and "innermost being"--tearing each to bits and throwing each aside, only to find that it kept creeping back. At length he said, "Where you're concerned, yes sir. I do, sir. I mean--"</p></blockquote><p> Those six jumps equate to the six moves a chess pawn would have to move forward to arrive at the last row of a chessboard and be subsequently "Queened." If you're familiar with chess and know the difficulty of queening a pawn you can almost guess the outcome of the story. But the path Chance takes, which meanders through the universe with a stop near Portland, Oregon, is one that will delight and titillate.</p><p> "And When They Appear" is a tale of a young boy who is being cared for by his parents' computerized house in a post-apocalypse world. Sherby, too young really to understand the evil in the world, is kept entertained by computer-generated holograms while a roving band of looters steadily approaches the house. With the power to override the house program, Sherby innocently creates a situation in which the house is destroyed and Sherby himself is "rescued" by a rather seedy and degenerate character. Thankfully, Wolfe spares the reader most of the details of Sherby's future. </p><p> The other strange tales in Wolfe's collection include a thought-provoking campfire horror story set in the far future; the story of the "mother" of intelligent robots being pursued by one of the beings she unwittingly helped create; and the adventures of three female time travelers, castaways on the shores of Earth. There's another horror yarn about a human boy who runs with ghouls and a tale about a boy who gets trapped in his sister's dollhouse each time he sleeps.</p><p> <i>Strange Travelers</i> is a broad and deep book by a master wordsmith. Like Wolfe's <i>Castle of Days</i>, <i>Strange Travelers</i> contains a few unclassifiable stories. This only enhances the rich landscape of this collection. <i>Strange Travelers</i> reaffirms Wolfe's adroitness and mastery in the short story genre. It's well worth losing a little sleep over. <i>--Robert Gately</i></p>Gene Wolfe has been called "the finest writer the science fiction world has yet produced" by <i>The Washington Post</i>.

She lives in New York and Washington, D.C.For those who like to eat well but can't stand the heat of long hours in the kitchen, Burros, New York Times food columnist, advances reliable methods for ever-faster meal preparation; her 20-minute menus (for two to three people, without dessert) are practical, healthful alternatives to take-out or frozen dinners. Burros explains how to trim shopping time to 10 minutes per day (by keeping staples on hand, shopping daily for each menu, buying hard-to-find food through mail order) and suggests buying pre-cut vegetables at salad bars and meats and fish in trimmed and packaged form. Following current diet trends, low-fat chicken and fish dishes are emphasized; cream sauces are made with ricotta and yogurt. Salt is decreased by seasoning food with herbs, ethnic condiments and flavored oils and vinegars. Sensibly, menus often combine the required starch, protein and vegetable components of a meal into one or two dishes, but leafy greens are lacking, and white sugar is used unnecessarily in dressings and tomato sauces. Each menu includes simple recipe instructions and shopping lists.

She lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.<b> Chapter One </b> <p><i>She was cloaked in mist -- soft as silk, cold as ice, darker than the bayou on a moonless night. "Marie." She was blind in a world without parameters, borders. Only sound. Raw feelings.</i></p> <p><i>"Marie."</i></p> <p><i>She couldn't breathe.</i></p> <p><i>"Marie" -- a dry, reedy call; then, mournful, like a keening from a wounded animal or a lost child. "Marie."</i></p> <p><i>The mist grew heavy, the weight of the world was pulling her down, sucking out air, life -- pulling her down into a swamp of memories:</i></p> <p><i>She, just ten, watching a man writhing on the floor, a snake circling his neck; she, a woman grown, strapped to a tree, scars crisscrossing her back; she, an old woman singing, "Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan"; she, trembling, diving into thick, heady water, catfish brushing her thighs; then, a mother, screaming, giving birth, as she, the babe, slipped out, swimming downstream in a rush of water, a bloodied, blue-red membrane covering her face.</i></p> <p>Except she was none of these. She was in her apartment, in her own bed. With a man she'd picked up at Cajun House. And she wasn't cold; she sweated from the heat of his body, from his hands stroking her breasts, his pelvis rubbing against hers.</p> <p><i>Was she dreaming? Hallucinating?</i></p> <p>"A haunting," her friend, Ellie, would say. "Spirits out of place. Talking." Marie didn't believe in ghosts. She was a doctor, objective. Good in a crisis.</p> <p><i>"Marie." A soft chant.</i></p> <p><i>"Marie." The mist cleared. Drums resounded and she swayed in a dress shimmering with rainbows. "Marie." Arms outstretched, flames spiraled from her fingertips. She felt herself rise. Snakes slithered across the floor. A sweet voice counterpointed the drums: "Home. Let's go home." A burst of light, a swirling of fireflies.</i></p> <p><i>"Marie." Hands tugged at her skirt, pulling her down. "Heal me"; "No, heal me." Faces: black, brown, white -- some staring reverently, some desperately, some enviously. Features fading: no eyes, only mouths. Wailing, screaming: "No, me. Heal me"; "Maman Marie, please. Heal me."</i></p> <p><i>Fingers plucked at her skin, ripping her skirt, tugging, threatening to trample her down to the ground.</i></p> <p><i>She screamed.</i></p> <p>"Sssh," a voice murmured, a tongue licking her ear.</p> <p>"Sssh," she echoed, chest heaving.</p> <p><i>Mist pressed against her eyes, breasts, abdomen. Her back arched. Mouth open, a mist flew inside her -- surrounding, squeezing her heart.</i></p> <p><i>Something -- someone -- rocked inside her, consuming her from the inside out. Eating her whole.</i> "Get out. Damn you, get out." Arms flailing, she bucked against the weight inside her. "Get out." <i>Shadows flew out of her mouth.</i></p> <p>Marie screamed.</p> <p>"Heh, you're not going crazy on me, are you? Not getting wild, are you?"</p> <p>He had a lovely smile. Skin, smooth as espresso; eyes, obsidian black.</p> <p>"You wish," she exhaled, trembling. "Get me a drink. Please."</p> <p>He reached for her warm, waterlogged scotch.</p> <p>"No, cold. There's beer in the fridge." She didn't watch him go. Didn't watch his panther strut. She'd hoped he'd be a good-enough lover so she wouldn't dream, hallucinate, or whatever the hell her mind was doing.</p> <p>She reached for her robe, catalogued her vitals -- pulse elevated, breath ragged; her hands, the top of her lip, moist with sweat. <i>Always the same. Same dream. Same moment of awakening.</i></p> <p>Marie shuddered. The dream always seemed real.</p> <p>Crotch moist, she'd wanted to swallow him whole. Wanted to be loved so well, she didn't have any weird dreams. She'd thought about saying "no" to a condom, hoping flesh upon flesh would banish dreams. Hauntings.</p> <p>But she knew better. Knew how sperm impregnated egg, seen cells dividing in a petri dish. Seen, too, a virus leeching on cells, devouring them, destroying in its wake. Seen plenty of young men, as beautiful as him, turn skeletal. Eyes sunken into bone. Seen young women, jaws slack, transfixed by nothingness.</p> <p>"Brought you a Coors. <i>Bien?"</i></p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Brought you a wet towel, too. Heated it up in the microwave."</p> <p>"This a sushi bar?"</p> <p><i>"Non.</i> Just a little courtesy. Thought you'd like to clean yourself off."</p> <p>Lord, he was good-looking. "How old are you?"</p> <p>"Nineteen."</p> <p>"Just a boy. You've got to go."</p> <p>In the dim, smoke-filled bar, she'd missed his youth. She'd been focused on the sway of his hips, the tilt of his head. Been focused on her need to be held.</p> <p>"All evening, I was man enough. Plenty, I'd say."</p> <p>Untying her robe, he kissed her neck. With her best tea towel, he gently wiped her breasts, abdomen, between her thighs. <i>"Tres belle,"</i> he murmured. <i>"Tres belle."</i></p> <p>She stood awkwardly, her arms dangling. He sat on the bed, his towel raised like an offering.</p> <p>"You should go," she said. "I've got to get to work."</p> <p>"See you?"</p> <p>"Maybe." She stared at the tangled sheets. Egyptian cotton scented with semen and the boy's smell. Musty with a hint of jasmine. Not a harsh thing about him. Just good-looking and sweet.</p> <p>His pants on, she blushed, remembering how she'd kissed his lean torso, let her hands roam inside cool linen, untied his drawstring belt.</p> <p>"Got any money? <i>Un peu?</i> A little?"</p> <p>"Out." She held up his shoes, socks. </p> <p>He winked, tucked his footwear beneath his arm and swept up his shirt from the floor. "Au'voir."</p> <p>She listened for the click of the door's latch.</p> <p>On the nightstand was a pack of Gauloises. She didn't smoke, but the blue package seemed as exotic as a black man speaking French.</p> <p>She stepped onto her narrow balcony -- wrought iron twisted into vines, leaves, a riotous garden with snakes that, depending upon the light, seemed to slither and weave from one end to the other.</p> <p>Not quite dawn. Stars twinkled bravely. The skyline fanned out like a lady ready for slumber on a chaise longue. Fog rolled in from the Gulf. Later, the city would be hot, steaming. Bodies would begin swaying, stripping away clothes, ordering bourbon, another hearing of "When the Saints Go Marching In," 'til it was dusk, mosquitoes rising, and time for another nightly round of dancing, loving, dying in the city. It both fascinated and repelled her.</p> <p>She felt she was back in time. No modern buildings, no high-rises. Only church spirals. Roofs with lattice trims. Gargoyles facing south. She liked the intricate warren of European-like streets. She'd been drawn to the top-floor apartment, just off the historic Quarter. Her rent was outrageous, but she liked the view, the scent of fish, beignets from the Caf� du Monde, the odor of alcohol, and too many bodies pressed into a too-tight space. She lit a cigarette, inhaled, and felt like the mist was inside her again. She pressed the cigarette against the rail. Sparks flew.</p> <p><i>"Cherie?"</i></p> <p>The boy was on the street, still barefoot, bare-chested. His shirt and shoes were tied together like a hobo sack, swinging from his hand. His feet moved -- two steps forward, hips dipping, sliding side to side, and she knew he was hearing the zydeco beat. The driving staccato, the unrestrained energy. He was hearing an intense two-step as old as the cobblestone. A rhythm built on the backs of slaves.</p> <p>When she'd met him, he'd said, "Dance," his hand outstretched. No, "Let's?" just a command: "Dance." She'd clutched his hand and swayed to the zydeco for hours, drank juleps, and, for a while, forgot she was a northerner down South. Forgot she was lonely. Out of her league. A battered young catfish, belly-up, flailing for air.</p> <p>"It was good, wasn't it?" he called up.</p> <p><i>"Bien. Tres bien,"</i> she said, and he smiled at her like a child given candy. She should've shouted: "No, a bad dream." But she didn't want to be heartless. Too many men had accused her of that.</p> <p><i>"Comment t'appelles-tu?"</i></p> <p>She shook her head. "What's yours?"</p> <p>"Jacques," he called up. Then, he spun around, dancing, fingers snapping, butt shaking down Rue de Christi. Without looking back, he waved. Gave an extra jerk to his behind.</p> <p>Marie laughed.</p> <p>Somewhere a voice caroled: "Catfish. Buy. Price fine. Come and buy."</p> <p>A child, no more than ten, wandered home from tap-dancing for tourists. Pop bottle caps were a poor boy's cleats. His shoes scraped and clicked. He yawned, rubbed his eyes.</p> <p>Three transvestites, legs wobbly on stiltlike heels, arms linked, wigs slightly askew, giggled. A tired sailor stepped out of a bar, his blond curls matted beneath his sailor cap. A man gripped his buttocks and they stumbled into an embrace. Then, hand outstretched, the thick-necked man guided the sailor around a corner, into an alley. Up against the wall.</p> <p>"Dance," Marie whispered, rueful. "Dance."</p> <p>Somewhere a sax began a lament. Church bells rang, a wild cacophony from parish churches: 6:00 A.M. Sunday. Time for all good Catholics to repent.</p> <p>Marie reached for another cigarette. What the hell. She was in a foreign land. New Orleans. Just words on a map. "Gateway to the Mississippi!" -- she'd been drawn like a moth to a flame. She should've gone to San Francisco. Kansas. Texas, even. Six months here and she couldn't have a climax without some will-o'wisp, some haint interfering, spoiling her body's pleasure.</p> <p>Inexplicably, she started to cry. She hadn't cried since she was ten and discovered her mother dead in their attic apartment.</p> <p>Furious, Marie wiped away tears.</p> <p>Jacques zigzagged down the street's heart. His shirt, now loose, flapped like a sail.</p> <p>She almost called out to him. What would she say? "Stop." "Don't leave." "I'm a stranger here."</p> <p>Why hadn't she told him her name? Marie Levant. Yet, for most of her life, she'd been called Mary. Only one day in New Orleans, and the <i>r</i> became guttural. Plain Mary became <i>Marie,</i> spoken with the flair and accent reminiscent of her mother. "Ma-<i>r</i>-ie." Her mother had called her that: "Ma-<i>r</i>-ie. My little girl."</p> <p>"Aw, Ma. Dearest Ma." She exhaled bitter smoke.</p> <p>The sun crowned like a baby, spreading blood across the horizon. Blackbirds dove, screeching like their feathers were on fire.</p> <p><i>Where was she?</i></p> <p><i>"Don't you know, child? City of Sin."</i></p> <p>She spun around. Her apartment was empty.</p> <p>Yet as surely as she was alive now, breath harsh, blood rushing beneath skin, wish...</p></p><h2>Bones of the Barbary Coast: A Cree Black Novel</h2><p><p><b>In this thrilling novel set in two periods of San Francisco history, Cree Black confronts the mystery of one of the strangest victims of the Great Quake</b>.</p><p>Bert Marchetti, an old family friend of Cree's and an SFPD homicide inspector, has asked Cree to help investigate a human skeleton recently unearthed in the foundation of a fine Victorian home&#x2015;apparently the bones of a victim of the 1906 earthquake. The bones have been sent to UC Berkeley for analysis, where their peculiar characteristics have intrigued the forensic anthropology team. They call the skeleton Wolfman.<br>Who was the wolfman? What caused his anatomical deformities, and how did he end up in that grand hilltop home? Cree's historical research takes her back to the unholy glory days of the Barbary Coast, old San Francisco's infamous red-light district. As she assists at the forensics lab, she also begins to realize that Bert Marchetti's involvement with the case is more complex than he has let on. Her narrative is illuminated by entries from the 1889 diary of Lydia Schweitzer, a Victorian woman with her own secrets&#x2015;and her own compelling interest in the person who would come to be known as the wolfman. A vivid and elegantly plotted thriller that reveals San Francisco's hidden face across two centuries, <i>Bones of the Barbary Coast </i>tells the story of two women determined to face human nature's darkest aspects with courage and compassion.</p></p><p><p><b>Daniel Hecht</b> is the author of the bestselling <i>Skull Session</i> and <i>Puppets</i>; The <i>Babel Effect</i>; and two novels in the Cree Black series, <i>City of Masks</i> and <i>Land of Echoes</i>. He lives in Montpelier, Vermont.</p>The lives of two women, past and present, intersect when a human skeleton-presumably a victim of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake-is unearthed in the foundation of a Victorian home. In present time, Cree Black's forensic and research abilities are challenged by the skeleton-which apparently walked on all fours. Going back in time, Lydia Schweitzer's 1906 diary exposes the degradation of the Barbary Coast, which serves as backdrop for the victim's life. Anna Fields's narration precisely delineates these two women. She slips into working-class Brooklynese when Cree is angry and effectively expresses Lydia's incredulity when she enters a brothel where patrons are entertained by deformed humans fighting feral dogs. When Fields narrates Black's own encounter with the dogs, her reading is haggard, gasping, and entirely believable.

After conferring with Emu, Cockatoo, and Echidna, Hunwick takes it back to his burrow and gives it a safe and cozy home. The odd egg, which refuses to hatch, becomes the gentle bandicoot's friend and confidante. Although Hunwick's neighbors are concerned about the situation, the creature comes to realize that the egg is actually a perfectly shaped stone and continues to "love it with all his heart." This slightly offbeat story with a universal message about the power of friendship is accompanied by glowing watercolor pencil illustrations in orange, pink, and violet tones that showcase the flora and fauna of the Australian landscape, adding an interesting element to this charming title. Young readers will appreciate Hunwick's loyalty and may be curious to learn more about the exotic animals portrayed in the lovely artwork.<i>&#x2013;Linda L.

The wife&#39;s brother, Navy Captain Frederick Wentworth, had been engaged to Anne in 1806, and now they meet again, both single and unattached, after no contact in more than seven years.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Grade 5-8 At first blush, <i>Shug</i> seems to be a typical contemporary novel about a middle school girl. But Han offers something more with her penetrating observation of Annemarie (Shug) as she becomes more aware of the people around her and of how they differ from her previous perceptions of them. Foremost on the 12-year-old's mind is her best friend since childhood, Mark, on whom she has developed a crush. Then it is her father, who breezes in from his business trips less and less frequently and stays for as little time as possible. Then it is her attractive mother, who reads Foucault and whose criticism of her fellow residents in their small North Carolina town starts to seem less like a matter of clear-eyed appraisal than of alcoholic bitterness. The bad boy whom Annemarie is forced to help with his schoolwork; her not-so-perfectly adjusted older sister; and even her popular new friend, the only Korean-American student in town, all receive reappraisal. Something has awakened in Annemarie, all right, and Han depicts the change with a delicacy and nuance that sets this first novel above the rest of the pack of similar books. This new author bears watching. <i>Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

BREATHES THERE, IN all the world, a mouse who is not stirred by those two words?<br> <br>Did the miniature monsters actually exist? Our leading mouse scientists were not certain, but they all believed the answer would be found in the Orient.<br> <br>It was Basil of Baker Street, the Sherlock Holmes of the Mouse World, who solved the mystery. He used his skill as a scientific sleuth to bring to light secrets long hidden behind the curtains of the past, secrets no other mouse had been able to discover.<br> <br>Professor Ratigan, leader of the mouse underworld, stalked him at every turn! Danger was Basil&#x2019;s constant companion. Ratigan&#x2019;s spies were at the border, in the jungle, on the ship, and&#x2014;<br> <br>But let me tell you how the adventure began.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>The year is 1894. The place is London, England, at Baker Street, Number 221B, where live Mr. Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Dr. John H. Watson.<br> <br>Mr. Holmes is the World&#x2019;s Greatest Human Detective. Basil is the World&#x2019;s Greatest Mouse Detective, and I, Dr. David Q. Dawson, am his friend.<br> <br>We dwell in the cellar of 221B, in the mouse town of Holmestead, which Basil named after his hero. My friend would often scurry up secret passageways to Mr. Holmes&#x2019; rooms. There he would take notes in shortpaw as the human detective told Dr. Watson exactly how he solved his difficult cases. One might say that Basil studied at the great man&#x2019;s feet.<br> <br><br> <br>Did Mr. Holmes ever see his small admirer, hidden in a corner? I believe he did, and that it pleased him to pass his methods on to a mouse.<br> <br>And such a mouse! I am of average height, about five inches tall, but Basil towers a full inch above me.<br> <br>My notebook is crammed with accounts of his cases. I am a busy doctor, but whenever possible, I take pen in paw to write of his achievements. Would that I had time to narrate them all!<br> <br>There was the Mystery of the Bald-Headed Mouse, a bank director. One foggy morning he stepped out of his office and vanished, along with a lot of the bank&#x2019;s money. Mouseland Yard detectives sought him with no success, but Basil studied the clues and found the bald banker in Edinburgh, wearing a wig and using another name. Most of the stolen funds were untouched, for spending large sums in Scotland would have drawn attention to the thief at once.<br> <br>Then there was the Case of the Guinea-Pig Gang. The honest mice of London dared not venture out at night until Basil cleverly found the criminals&#x2019; hideout and had them all jailed.<br> <br>But of all his cases, Basil&#x2019;s own favorite is the Adventure of the Cave of Cats. It put to use all his remarkable skill as a sleuth, plus his vast knowledge of the science of archeology.<br> <br>Basil&#x2019;s hobby was archeology. He had discovered Rockhenge, the ancient mouse ruins near London.<br> <br>Interviewed by newspapermice, Basil said, &#x201c;The most exciting detective work in the world is archeology! As we dig, clues keep turning up. Arrowheads, old weapons, broken bowls&#x2014;any or all may hold clues to the life and times of prehistoric mice. The calendar stone I found at Rockhenge, for example, proved that mice perfected a 365-day calendar long before mankind. Clearly, archeology is the highest form of detective work, for lessons we learn from the past help mice to build a better, brighter future!&#x201d;<br> <br>The clues concerning the cave of cats were to take us halfway across the world, to the Far East.<br> <br>Originally we had planned our trip to the Orient for a different reason&#x2014;to restore the Maharajah of Bengistan to his rightful throne.<br> <br>Cyril the Stoolpigeon had brought word that our enemy, Professor Ratigan, now ruled Bengistan, a mouse kingdom near India.<br> <br>Too large to enter, the pigeon stood at our window to tell us what a little bird had told him.<br> <br><br> <br>In a surprise move the Professor and his gang had stormed and taken the palace. They guarded the border day and night. The Maharajah was unharmed, but kept prisoner in his private apartments in the palace. Ratigan taxed everything, even cheese! Mice too poor to pay the tax starved. And all the tax money went into Ratigan&#x2019;s pockets!<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Cyril,&#x201d; said Basil. &#x201c;You may pick up your reward at the back window. Mrs. Judson, our mousekeeper, baked blackberry tarts today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cyril, grinning happily, was off in a trice.<br> <br>Basil&#x2019;s eyes blazed. &#x201c;That rat Ratigan! Robbing our friend of his throne! I cannot stand idly by&#x2014;we leave for the Orient at dawn. Can you arrange to have another doctor attend your patients?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could, and did, by nightfall. Then, having packed, we relaxed in easy chairs before the fire.<br> <br>The doorbell jangled, and Mrs. Judson ushered in Dr. Edvard Hagerup, a Norwegian scientist from the British Mousmopolitan Museum.<br> <br>After we all shook paws, he held up a golden goblet of ancient design. I reproduce it below.<br> <br>Basil studied the goblet, and chuckled. &#x201c;My word! Elotana, Goddess of Goodness! European mice worshipped her thousands of years ago. Look&#x2014;kneeling before her are cats scarcely the size of mice! Where was the goblet found?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;In Turkey,&#x201d; said Hagerup. &#x201c;It proves that miniature cats existed. We of the Mousmopolitan know you are going to the Orient. We feel you are the only mouse who can solve this mystery. Will you try?&#x201d;<br> <br>Basil nodded. &#x201c;Gladly, after I&#x2019;ve captured Ratigan. A noted archeologist once said, &#x2018;One pits one&#x2019;s wits against the past!&#x2019; How true! This will be the most challenging case of my career!&#x201d;<br> <br>Quickly Basil sketched the scene on the goblet, and the Norwegian departed with the original.<br> <br>That night scores of miniature cats marched through my slumbers, shaking with fright at the sight of me. Seldom have I enjoyed more delightful dreams!</p><h2>Illustrated Jewish Bible for Children</h2><p>A selection of key passages from the Jewish Bible by a team of educators and scholars highlights the stories&#39; human interest and includes illustrations portraying key incidents and symbols, a guide to important Old Testament figures, and maps and photographs.</p><p>Grade 2-6?Stories from the Hebrew Bible are retold and accompanied by drawings, maps, and captioned photographs. The retellings are brief and would be more useful for information than for reading aloud. The illustrations are often crowded, unexceptional, and unattractive. It is curious to look at a contemporary, unlabeled photograph of a young girl who is probably from the Middle East and read that Rachel "would have been young, with a natural beauty like this girl." It is also curious that in the description of the Creation, the text reads, "And so ended the first day and night of creation." The Hebrew text puts evening ahead of day, which is why Jewish holidays always begin at sunset.

Because it makes me happy. Unlike other books on morality, this one focuses on why we should bother to live virtuously. Each person&#39;s own experience, if he knows how to examine it, teaches that the deep human hunger for happiness is satisfied only by a virtuous life. And with the right road map, a virtuous life is possible. The Examined Life is full of practical wisdom for the moral journey to happiness, a journey that passes from knowing yourself to owning yourself to giving yourself. Helming zeroes in on the concrete struggles of everyday life where the virtues are really lived(struggles involving chastity, work, study, friendship, love, marriage, and parenthood. Each chapter concludes with a dozen or so practical points to work on. The book includes a thought-provoking(if often amusing(list of &#34;45 Ways to be Chaste&#34; and a bibliography for further reading.</p><p>Dennis Helming graduated from Harvard University and studied philosophy in Rome and at the University of Navarre. He has worked as a teacher, writer, editor, and journalist in New York and Washington, D.C., where he now lives. He is the author of Footprints in the Snow (Scepter Publishers) and numerous articles and booklets on fatherhood.Dennis Helming has set for himself no easy task: to update and complete what he regards as the ethical project of Plato and Aristotle. Helming believes that the ethical project stalled with these classical thinkers, who were able to provide a kind of moral map based on enlightened self-interest that promised fulfillment by way of self-domination and virtue. While Christian thinkers from Augustine on down were admittedly concerned with the ideal of self-giving, their promise or reward of punishment in the next world, says Helming, proved too remote for most to serve as an incentive for virtuous living. Besides, without solid foundation in the human virtues necessary to self-possession, the project of giving oneself freely to God and others becomes untenable, at best. <p>Helming, from the sound of it, would probably be none too pleased with this assessment, but his book is far more likely to appeal to believing Christians-and specifically Catholics-as a roadmap for acquiring the human virtues necessary to act as consistent followers of Christ, than it is your run-of-the-mill post Christian hedonist, ostensibly unsatisfied with his current dreary existence. -- <i>Brian Robertson: CRISIS, May, 1998</i><br><br>In its impressive inaugural season Spence Publishing Company offers The Examined Life, by Dennis Helming: an effort to convince young men (the book's primary audience) that they should practice virtue(if not for supernatural motives, then simply because virtue is conducive to personal happiness. Helming provides blunt, detailed, and occasionally idiosyncratic practical answers to the moral questions of adolescence in a thoroughly original style which is utterly unlike the typical self-help book(perhaps vaguely reminiscent of the earliest editions of the Boy Scout Handbook in its gruff, distinctively masculine expression of traditional moral truths, but still better described by one reviewer as "a unique blend of classical wisdom and Yankee pragmatism. -- <i>Dennis Helming, <i> Catholic World Report</i> </i></p></p><h2>The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared</h2><p><p>The international publishing sensation&#x2014;over two million copies sold.</p><p>A reluctant centenarian much like Forrest Gump (if Gump were an explosives expert with a fondness for vodka) decides it&#x2019;s not too late to start over ...</p><p>After a long and eventful life, Allan Karlsson ends up in a nursing home, believing it to be his last stop.

He is a professor at the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles.This vast and lavish study by Klein, a professor at the California Institute of the Arts, more than fulfills the promise of its title, but it is less a straightforwardly technical "history of special effects" Hollywood style than an account of history <i>as</i> special effect, as mediated spectacle and controlled illusion. There is almost no end to the ingenuity, Klein argues, with which the powerful have used every technical and aesthetic means at their disposal to stage-manage reality, from the court masques of Jacobean England to the Magic Kingdoms of Orange County. Klein (<i>The History of Forgetting</i>; <i>Bleeding Through</i>) offers the reader a panorama of deception and sleight-of-hand as richly detailed as one of the rococo wonderments he describes. In detailing the complex history of what he describes as "one's fondest desires and worst nightmares joined at the same instant," Klein eruditely decodes, with fluency and ease, everything from the hierarchies of mannerist architecture to the "entertainment baroque" of Las Vegas. The book's four sections (including 50 b&amp;w and 20 color illustrations) weave such disparate matter as Poe's fictions, Piranesi's labyrinths, the geography of Oz and the absurd logic of "cartoon physics" into a narrative that, if not seamless, reveals our culture's "engines of erasure" in daring and frequently surprising ways. Much of the book's energy is frankly polemical: the presidential election of 2000 acts as the summation of Klein's story, the place where the manipulation of "false memories" reaches an apex of cynicism and effectiveness. Whether or not one agrees with this thesis, it gives the book an undeniable urgency. And it makes the occasionally rushed and overtelegraphed prose feel more like passionate intensity than carelessness.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His right hand held its barrel while his right foot backstopped the weapon&#x2019;s hand-carved stock. He wore buckskin leggings, a shirt and pants of woven linsey-woolsey, which gave him a tramplike appearance. A broad-brimmed felt hat shadowed his predator&#x2019;s eyes.</p> <p>He stood alone, immune to the battle raging around him. The din had no parallel in his life&#x2014;the crash of gunfire, the roar of cannon juxtaposed against distant bagpipes, and a New Orleans band belting out &#x201c;Yankee Doodle.&#x201d; Around him, men died by the hundreds.</p> <p>Across the battlefield, a group of British officers rode together. One, Lieutenant L. Walcott, sighted the Shooter and marveled at his poise. Suddenly, the Shooter moved. He shouldered his rifle and its barrel swung toward Walcott&#x2019;s party. The officers began to laugh. The American was over three hundred yards away, no way he could hit any of them. The gesture seemed ridiculous.</p> <p>The Shooter pulled the trigger and shot one of the British officers right out of his saddle. His lifeless body flopped to the ground. The others in Walcott&#x2019;s group gaped at their dead comrade, shocked that one of their own could be killed so effortlessly at a distance that rendered their own weapons ineffective. Several long seconds later, they wrenched their attention back to the rampart. The Shooter had returned to his statuesque stance, rifle in hand, stock at his toes again. Beneath the brim of his hat, he tracked them and selected another target. The rifle came up and belched black smoke. The officer next to Lieutenant Walcott jerked back and fell off his horse.</p> <p>Two shots, two kills. Walcott later recalled, &#x201c;The cannon and the thousands of musket balls playing upon our ranks we cared not for; for there was a chance of escaping them&nbsp;&#x2026; but to know that every time that rifle was leveled toward us&nbsp;&#x2026; one must surely fall&nbsp;&#x2026; that the messenger of death drove unerringly to its goal, to know this and still march on was awful.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Shooter reloaded and resighted his weapon. Walcott and his surviving comrades exchanged terror-filled glances and wondered who would be the next of them to die.</p> <p>Death on the battlefield is a random act. In the middle of a fight, a man can endure flying bullets and falling artillery because of their indiscriminate nature. The soldier in the heat of combat has built in psychological defenses to such incoming. <i>It can&#x2019;t hit me. The odds are with me. They aren&#x2019;t aiming at me.</i></p> <p>The Shooter stripped away those defenses, leaving Walcott naked to the primal fear aimed fire instills. For Walcott&#x2019;s group, there was no escape, and they realized it after the Shooter&#x2019;s second kill. Such a realization causes entire units to seize up in the midst of battle. Men who moments before were filled with courage or resolve will forget everything as their self-preservation instincts kick in. They will go to ground. They will cease advancing. They will lose control and run. Such elemental fear breeds panic, and in a test of arms, the ability to create panic wins battles. We call this the Shock Factor. It is a sniper&#x2019;s greatest weapon.</p> <p>The Shooter&#x2019;s finger curled around the trigger, his rifle&#x2019;s front sight pinned on the officer riding beside Lieutenant Walcott. The Shooter had no scope, just his remarkable eyesight and a knack for gauging the wind and his bullet&#x2019;s drop. He took a breath, released half of it, and gently squeezed the trigger. Another of Walcott&#x2019;s friends was shot out of the saddle, probably dead before he even hit the ground.</p> <p>Unlike his targets, the Shooter was not a professional officer. He was a frontiersman, born and raised in Tennessee or Kentucky, where a man&#x2019;s marksmanship determined the margin between life and death. His rifle was his most valued possession, precision-made by hand with loving care, its stock inlaid with ornate silver designs. It had probably been a family heirloom, handed down from one male member of the family to the next as part of his culture&#x2019;s rite of passage. Like his fellow &#x201c;Dirty Shirt&#x201d; frontiersmen, he joined this battle carrying his personal weapon. There were no government-issued guns waiting for him at the end of his passage south to face the British.</p> <p>That was fine with him. His rifle was an extension of himself. In all likelihood, he&#x2019;d been shooting it since he was a boy as he learned to hunt with his father or uncles. Bullets and powder did not come easily, so every shot counted in his world. In time, he developed such precision with his weapon that he could kill a squirrel by shooting the branch it was sitting on and sending wood shrapnel into the creature. That left the animal intact and edible. On the battlefield, such skill translated into deadly precision&#x2014;and lots of headshots. He was an American rifleman; marksmanship was coded into his DNA. At New Orleans, future president Andrew Jackson had assembled the only sharpshooting army in United States history&#x2014;and being on the receiving end of it must have been horrific.</p> <p>Lieutenant Walcott was one of the lucky few British officers to survive the Battle of New Orleans. American rifleman killed or wounded virtually the entire British chain of command in less than twenty-five minutes of battle. The 93rd Highlanders, who marched toward our Shooter on the rampart with bagpipes blasting, went into the fight a thousand strong. Just short of the American lines, their regimental commander ordered his men to halt. Seconds later, an American rifleman killed him with a headshot. The rest of the regimental leadership went down before anyone could give an order. The 93rd stood there, shoulder to shoulder, its veteran soldiers completely at a loss for what to do next. They had never faced this sort of accurate fire before, and it paralyzed them. Not a man even returned fire.</p> <p>The American dirty shirts poured it on. Six hundred Highlanders went down before the unit finally broke and ran. All across the battlefield, other British units did the same thing. Men who had never taken cover during a fight now sought any fold in the landscape that might offer respite from the deadly American bullets.</p> <p>General Adair, commander of the Kentucky Riflemen, walked his line, pointing out targets to his men. He tapped one dirty shirt from behind and said, &#x201c;See that officer on the gray horse?&#x201d; The marksman nodded at the distant, moving target. Adair ordered, &#x201c;Snuff his candle.&#x201d; The Kentuckian took aim and shot him right off his horse.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the battle, a British colonel named Rennie led an assault on an isolated American redoubt emplaced ahead of the main rampart. He struck an impressive figure at the head of his men, coaxing them forward. The Americans in the redoubt abandoned their posts and scampered back to the main line. Rennie pressed forward and scaled the rear wall of the redoubt with two of his officers by his side. As he turned to urge his troops onward, several shooters from the New Orleans Rifles, a militia unit from the Big Easy, opened fire. All three officers went down. The leaderless British soldiers froze, then fell back pell-mell, their ranks savaged by the American fire.</p> <p>Afterward an argument broke out among the New Orleans sharpshooters over who killed the British colonel. The best marksman in town, a merchant named Mr. Withers, flatly said, &#x201c;If he isn&#x2019;t hit above the eyebrows, it wasn&#x2019;t my shot.&#x201d; After the battle, the New Orleans Rifles retrieved the colonel&#x2019;s body from a ditch&#x2014;and found he&#x2019;d been struck in the forehead. That settled the debate.</p> <p>A half hour into the Battle of New Orleans and the British army had been reduced to panicked survivors cowering amongst heaps of their dead and dying comrades. Some sought to escape from the American shooters by low crawling. It didn&#x2019;t work. The Shooter on the rampart was joined by hundreds more who waited patiently until their quarries exposed legs, arms, or parts of their heads. The dirty shirts were used to bagging quail, squirrels, and hares on the run at seemingly impossible ranges; the British soldier who gave up even the tiniest part of his body paid the price. A flash, a report, and the target went down.</p> <p>Others tried to flee the kill zone in quick rushes. The shooters were too adept for this to work. Those British soldiers died almost as soon as they stood up, except for one who proved particularly fleet-footed. He rose several hundred yards from the American ramparts and dashed like a rabbit toward the rear. Several shooters fired and missed him, which emboldened the Brit. He flopped to the ground, waited a few seconds, then stood up and mooned the Americans. Shouting obscenities, he sprinted rearward and took cover before anyone could kill him. Finally, the Americans brought forth one of their best sharpshooters. He eased into his stance, sighted his rifle, and waited. After a long pause, the Brit stood up, mooned the Americans again, and started to run. The American pulled the trigger and killed him with a shot to the spine, right between his shoulder blades. Mercy was absent that day.</p> <p>For most of those soldiers trapped in the American kill zone, there would be no escape. One by one, the frontiersmen picked them off. Terror-filled cries rang out. Calls for help went unheeded. When the last shot had been fired, over fifteen hundred corpses littered the battlefield. Sixty Americans had died, almost all to artillery fire at the start of the fighting.</p> <p>New Orleans is a case study in how precision marksmanship can destroy a numerically superior foe&#x2019;s will to fight. Despite having better weapons, better supplies, veteran troops and leaders, the British stood no chance in the face of the dirty shirts and their stunning accuracy. In minutes, that accuracy shredded their officer corps and left the foot soldiers leaderless and panicked in the kill zone. When they started to break and run, they received no respite. The British army came apart in a welter of blood and terror, victim of the Shock Factor applied on a macro scale.</p> <p>I witnessed the Shock Factor firsthand many times during my career. During one fight in Iraq in the 2003 invasion, I spotted a two-man Iraqi machine-gun team in a window of a building while I was scanning for targets from the hatch of one of our Amtracs&#x2014;an amphibious armored personnel carrier. The two men were so close together, I couldn&#x2019;t tell who was the loader and who was the gunner. I drew a bead on them just as they swung their weapon toward another Amtrac not fifty yards from their building.</p> <p>I pulled the trigger once. My M40 barked, and the loader vanished from the window. The gunner was so stunned by his comrade&#x2019;s death that he couldn&#x2019;t move. This surprise and fear-borne paralysis is a significant way we snipers psychologically dominate our battlefields. I racked my M40 rifle&#x2019;s bolt and killed the frozen gunner with my second shot.</p> <p>When an enemy force advances into a sniper&#x2019;s zone of control, one well-placed bullet can stop the assault in its tracks. As soon as the enemy troops realize they are under precision sniper fire, they will often seek cover and stay there until the sniper either leaves or is taken out&#x2014;no easy task. Often, the Shock Factor causes strange reactions. The death of one of their own, combined with the sound of only a single shot, acts like a reset button on the neural circuitry of the men nearby. They&#x2019;ll dive for cover, only to pick totally exposed places. They&#x2019;ll freeze up, as the Iraqi gunner did; they&#x2019;ll run in odd directions or return fire randomly. Some will flee. Some will cower. Some will babble nonsensical orders. A very few will actually continue to function and search for the sniper&#x2019;s position. They are the ones we usually make priority targets.</p> <p>In Somalia, I learned that a sniper doesn&#x2019;t even need to kill an enemy to create the Shock Factor and psychologically dominate him. My spotter and I had just climbed atop the Spaghetti Factory, a tall building in the heart of Mogadishu that provided a good vantage point of the city. While a platoon of our men conducted a patrol a few hundred yards to our left, we started to scan the area. The first thing we saw was a group of teenaged boys huddled together. On previous missions into the city, we&#x2019;d seen these sorts of human clusters and learned to recognize that they usually meant the kids involved were up to no good. They were usually smuggling something the huddle was designed to conceal, like drugs or ammunition or weapons. We call behavior like this a tell, or a target indicator.</p> <p>This time, they were circled around a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boy who held an American-made M1 Garand rifle that dated back to the Second World War. I centered my scope on the kid and saw he wore cut-off jeans and flip-flops. Like the other kids, he was shirtless and super-model skinny. We checked the wind. Three to five miles an hour&#x2014;not a factor at the distance between my rifle&#x2019;s barrel and the kid, who was one hundred sixty-eight yards away.</p> <p>The gaggle of kids began to move toward our patrolling Marines. The boy with the rifle looked like he was psyching himself up to take a shot. I watched through my scope, reporting everything I saw while praying that he&#x2019;d lose heart. I could not let him shoot a Marine and tear worlds apart back home, but I could not stand the thought of killing a child.</p> <p>He and his pals kept moving toward the platoon. Soon, they&#x2019;d be in a position to open fire. My mind raced, searching for options.</p> <p>Inspiration struck. I adjusted the crosshairs and pinned them on the M1 Garand&#x2019;s stock. The boy was carrying it low with one hand wrapped around its receiver. The stock jutted out behind him as he walked.</p> <p>I pulled the trigger. The stock splintered. The stunned children scattered as the boy dropped the Garand. I scanned their faces and saw shock on all of them. They stopped running a few seconds later, then looked around as if they&#x2019;d been witness to some sort of supernatural event. I hoped this would convince them to go on home, but teenage bravado prevailed. The boy in the cut-offs and flip-flops steeled himself and returned to his weapon. As he bent down, I put a round right into the dirt next to the Garand. It kicked up a cloud of dust and the rifle jerked. The boy leapt backwards, as if the gun were possessed. The other boys scattered again.</p> <p>Long seconds passed. The boys approached the Garand one more time like kids goading themselves through a cemetery at midnight. When they tried one more time to retrieve the weapon, I put another bullet beside it. That did it. The boys scampered off and left the weapon in the dirt. I later retrieved it and took it home as a souvenir.</p> <p>Without taking a killing shot, my accuracy destroyed the boy&#x2019;s will to fight. That is significant power, and no other element on the battlefield has it.</p> <p>In the years since the Shooter killed Lieutenant Walcott&#x2019;s brother officers at New Orleans, the technology and science of long-range precision marksmanship has undergone multiple revolutions. They have served to widen the kill zone for us, which in turn has magnified our psychological power. Today, we snipers are more flexible. Night is no longer an obstacle. Neither is weather. But even as we adapted the latest hi-tech gadgets, the basic skill sets the Shooter used in 1815 have remained the same. They are the same principles I learned when I became a sniper some one hundred seventy years after the Battle of New Orleans.</p> <p>More than once our community has been disbanded. Wars end and snipers are the first to be trimmed from peacetime military budgets. We&#x2019;ve paid the price for those mistakes when we&#x2019;ve found ourselv...</p></p><h2>Letters from Father Christmas</h2><p>For New condition books; You will be the first to open the book cover.

His books have been translated into more than fifty languages and have sold many millions of copies worldwide.Don't miss this little gem amidst all the fanfare of Tolkien's novels and Hollywood film. Each year, starting in the early 1920s Tolkien responded to his children's letters to Father Christmas with notes and drawings. He introduces the chores of packing the many packages, the mishaps of weather and the mischief of his faithful helper, North Polar Bear, to his sons and daughter--whose names are added or omitted from the letters as the family grows. Derek Jacobi is fully in the spirit of these epistles, and listeners hear how Tolkien, also, elaborates with one year's letters, and can only send a few lines and a drawing the next. The one missed step is the annoying choice of just one music selection which separates the letters. Nevertheless, make this audio program a holiday tradition.

Vanguard, Volume 1 (No playing Cards)</h2><p><br><strong>Note: This book will not include the playing cards anymore. </strong><br>Aichi Sendou is a timid middle school teen. He is so shy that even conversing in class is a bit of a challenge. However, one thing him going through all his struggles - Vanguard. With his ultra-rare Blaster Blade card always by his side, he knew that at least in the gaming world he had a chance to be different.<br><br>Unfortunately for Aichi, his favorite card was stolen by a vengeful classmate. Furthermore, the Blaster Blade was later lost in a winner-takes all competition to one of the best players around his community. Now to retrieve his priceless card, Aichi is going to have to break from his mold of shyness and win his property back by finally engaging someone, and in this case a local champ, in an actual Vanguard card-battle! His first battle with Toshiki Kai was an eye-opener. It was part learning experience and part coming-of-age moment. And with that first battle and that unexpected first win Aichi was now on his way towards fully immersing himself in the world of the card game!</p><p>Akira Itou is a writer, gamer, and international best-selling comic artist. Over the last decade his work has been associated with some of the world's most popular trading card games - YuGiOh and Vanguard. <br><br>Raised in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, Itou cut his teeth as an assistant for Studio Dice and YuGiOh creator Kazuki Takahashi. After working as an assistant on the original YuGiOh comic, Itoh would evnetually come to draw the YuGiOh sequel YuGiOh R. The series was a regular feature in Shonen Jump Magazine for four years and significantly expanded the brand from comic for teens to full-blown gaming narrative. After working with the YuGiOh franchise for nearly a decade, Itoh would pair up with Japanese trading card leaders BushiRoad to develop a new card game - Vanguard. Vanguard would premiere as a serialized manga in 2010 to lay the foundation for a TRPG which would debut globally February 2011. The brand has spun-off a weekly prime-time animated TV series, which is currently available globally in English on YouTube, with Itou as part of the production team.</p><h2>Mefisto</h2><p>very good 1st ed, DJ has light wear, a little foxing on folds and fore edge, else excellent.</p><p>John Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945.

He was, as Graham Greene declared, &#x201c;one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.1<br><br>As a kid I was the youngest member of my family, and the youngest child in any family is always a jokemaker, because a joke is the only way he can enter into an adult conversation. My sister was five years older than I was, my brother was nine years older than I was, and my parents were both talkers. So at the dinner table when I was very young, I was boring to all those other people. They did not want to hear about the dumb childish news of my days. They wanted to talk about really important stuff that happened in high school or maybe in college or at work. So the only way I could get into a conversation was to say something funny. I think I must have done it accidentally at first, just accidentally made a pun that stopped the conversation, something of that sort. And then I found out that a joke was a way to break into an adult conversation.<br><br>I grew up at a time when comedy in this country was superb&#x2014;it was the Great Depression. There were large numbers of absolutely top comedians on radio. And without intending to, I really studied them. I would listen to comedy at least an hour a night all through my youth, and I got very interested in what jokes were and how they worked.<br><br>When I&#x2019;m being funny, I try not to offend. I don&#x2019;t think much of what I&#x2019;ve done has been in really ghastly taste. I don&#x2019;t think I have embarrassed many people, or distressed them. The only shocks I use are an occasional obscene word. Some things aren&#x2019;t funny. I can&#x2019;t imagine a humorous book or skit about Auschwitz, for instance. And it&#x2019;s not possible for me to make a joke about the death of John F. Kennedy or Martin Luther King. Otherwise I can&#x2019;t think of any subject that I would steer away from, that I could do nothing with. Total catastrophes are terribly amusing, as Voltaire demonstrated. You know, the Lisbon earthquake is funny.<br><br>I saw the destruction of Dresden. I saw the city before and then came out of an air-raid shelter and saw it afterward, and certainly one response was laughter. God knows, that&#x2019;s the soul seeking some relief.<br><br>Any subject is subject to laughter, and I suppose there was laughter of a very ghastly kind by victims in Auschwitz.<br><br>Humor is an almost physiological response to fear. Freud said that humor is a response to frustration&#x2014;one of several. A dog, he said, when he can&#x2019;t get out a gate, will scratch and start digging and making meaningless gestures, perhaps growling or whatever, to deal with frustration or surprise or fear.<br><br>And a great deal of laughter is induced by fear. I was working on a funny television series years ago. We were trying to put a show together that, as a basic principle, mentioned death in every episode and that this ingredient would make any laughter deeper without the audience&#x2019;s realizing how we were inducing belly laughs.<br><br>There is a superficial sort of laughter. Bob Hope, for example, was not really a humorist. He was a comedian with very thin stuff, never mentioning anything troubling. I used to laugh my head off at Laurel and Hardy. There is terrible tragedy there somehow. These men are too sweet to survive in this world and are in terrible danger all the time. They could be so easily killed.<br>Even the simplest jokes are based on tiny twinges of fear, such as the question, &#x201c;What is the white stuff in bird poop?&#x201d; The auditor, as though called upon to recite in school, is momentarily afraid of saying something stupid. When the auditor hears the answer, which is, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s bird poop, too,&#x201d; he or she dispels the automatic fear with laughter. He or she has not been tested after all.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do firemen wear red suspenders?&#x201d; And &#x201c;Why did they bury George Washington on the side of a hill?&#x201d; And on and on.<br><br>True enough, there are such things as laughless jokes, what Freud called gallows humor. There are real-life situations so hopeless that no relief is imaginable.<br><br>While we were being bombed in Dresden, sitting in a cellar with our arms over our heads in case the ceiling fell, one soldier said as though he were a duchess in a mansion on a cold and rainy night, &#x201c;I wonder what the poor people are doing tonight.&#x201d; Nobody laughed, but we were still all glad he said it. At least we were still alive! He proved it.</p><h2>Love from Nancy : The Letters of Nancy Mitford</h2><p>Contains Nancy Mitford&#39;s humorous letters to her family and friends. Mitford never wrote an autobiography, but this collection of letters provides a portrayal of her life and the times in which she lived.</p><p>Charlotte Mosley lives in Paris and has worked as a publisher and journalist. She is the editor of Love from Nancy, The Letters of Nancy Mitford, The Letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh and The Mitfords, Letters Between Six Sisters.The first collection of Nancy Mitford's letters--which, like those of her British literary contemporaries (Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, Cyril Connolly, et. al), reflect a wit and style that never quite mask an underlying anguish at a world changed too much. Born in 1904 and dying in Paris in 1973, Mitford was a diligent correspondent who left behind more than a thousand letters. This collection (edited by her niece), spanning more than 60 years and a hundred correspondents, includes not only letters that provide an epistolary history of Mitford's life but also those that illuminate her relationship with her famous peers and equally famous--or, as often, notorious--sisters: Jessica, author of The American Way of Death; Unity, admirer of Hitler; and Diana, wife of British fascist Sir Oswald Mosley. Like her friend Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, Mitford's letters are written to or about that brilliant between-the-wars-generation that connected and reconnected in the company of interesting people in stylish milieus like the British embassy in Paris; Chatsworth, the ducal home of Mitford's youngest sister; and the Guinness's Irish castle. Many names here will be unfamiliar--and the need to consult footnotes is an irritant--but what makes the reading worthwhile are letters like the one in which Mitford relates Evelyn Waugh's answer when asked how he reconciled being so horrible with being a Christian. ``He replied rather sadly that were he not a Christian he would be even more horrible.'' Mitford writes with great wit and plucky panache- -making the best of an often unhappy personal life--about her writing, her friends, and contemporary events: the bombing raids in wartime London, Dior's ``New Look,'' the 1968 riots in Paris, etc. A welcome addition to literary history that poignantly recalls the glittering youth and not-so-bright decline and fall of all those ``bright young things'' whom Mitford and Waugh wrote about so well elsewhere.

Inspired by the plays, actors and customs of kabuki theatre, and using vibrant new chemical dyes imported from Europe, Kunichika created a visually dazzling pictorial record of this long-lost, decadent underworld of old Edo. As well as creating "mirrors" of popular productions and stars, he also cast the most dynamic actors of his time in the roles of tattooed robbers, samurai, female bandits and other elements from society's fringes, immortalising them in dozens of intense and intricate print series and tableaux. Even as ukiyo-e came under threat from the emergence of new imaging technologies, Kunichika remained true to his art until the very end of the 19th century.<br><br>DECADENCE AND DISSOLUTION &#x2015; edited by Jack Hunter (who also edited the ground-breaking extreme ukiyo-e anthology "Dream Spectres") &#x2015; collects over 150 of Kunichika's most striking and innovative designs from kabuki theatre, presented in large-format and full-colour throughout. Many have never been published before, even in Japan. Extensive sections on tattoo pictures, single-sheet actor portraits and wide-screen triptychs are augmented by a foreword and a listing of Kunichika's most important series.<br><br>Fourth in a dynamic new series presenting the cutting edge of 19th century Japanese art.</p><p>Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) was a leaidng Japanese woodblock print artist. Talented as a child, at about thirteen he became a student of Tokyo's then-leading print maker, Utagawa Kunisada. His deep appreciation and knowledge of kabuki drama led to his production primarily of ukiyo-e actor-prints, which are woodblock prints of kabuki actors and scenes from popular plays of the time.<br><br>Jack Hunter is author and editor of over 20 books on cinema, including EROS�&#x20ac;&#x2c6;IN�&#x20ac;&#x2c6;HELL and MOONCHILD, as well as the popular book on Japanese art, DREAM�&#x20ac;&#x2c6;SPECTRES, and the counter-culture classic FREAK�&#x20ac;&#x2c6;BABYLON.Born Oshima Yasohachi in 1835, in the Kyobashi area of Edo, and also known as Arawaka Yasohachi, Toyohara Kunichika derived his artist name from the two teachers who schooled him from the age of eleven onwards &#x2015; Toyohara Chikanobu and Utagawa Kunisada, the latter a recognised ukiyo-e master. Kunichika's first published prints appeared in the early 1850s, and he first came to public attention in the 1860s. Some of the best-known series he produced from 1863 onwards include Mitate shiranami hakkei ("8 Parodies Of Bandits, 1865); Kandehon Chushingura ("47 Ronin", 1866); and Adesugata kesho jiman ("Pride Of Beauties Dressing", 1866), the latter an example of his frequent bijinga (pictures of beautiful women) excursions, which perhaps peaked in 1890's Mitate chuya nijuyoji no uchi (Parody Of The 24 Hours Of The Day"). Like other ukiyo-e artists, Kunichika ventured into several genres, including shunga (erotic prints), book illustration, and also shinbun nishiki-e (news-sheets), producing several works for the Tokyo kakushu shinbun around 1876.<br><br> Kunichika's prints of the 1860s also feature numerous musha-e (warrior) subjects, such as his popular triptych Suikoden jigoku meguri ("Suikoden Heroes In Hell", 1864), and his 1868 series Zan-aku kijin kagami ("Demonic Mirror of Good And Evil") often rivals Yoshitoshi's innovative 100 Warriors In Battle,1 from the same year, in its dynamism and kinetic violence.2 The fundamental difference between these two series, however, is that whereas Yoshitoshi was drawing inspiration from real life (having witnessed first-hand the bloody Battle of Ueno), Kunichika's figures were derived from another arena &#x2015; the kabuki stage.<br><br> In 1869, Kunichika intensified his production of yakusha-e ("actor portraits") with an innovative 22-part series showing kabuki actors' faces in extreme close-up, and set against richly coloured backgrounds created with imported chemical dyes. He also exported this close-up technique to the diptych and triptych formats, portraying actors in half-body poses, often employing anamorphic distortion.<br><br> From that point onward Kunichika became the foremost chronicler of kabuki theatre, developing a comprehensive knowledge of plays, players, and performances. In particular, he would document the many roles essayed by the three leading actors of his time &#x2015; Ichikawa Danjuro IX (1839-1903), Onoe Kikugoro V (also known as Baiko, 1844-1903), and Ichikawa Sadanji I (1842-1904). ....</p><h2>Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism</h2><p>A catalog to an exhibition that explores the influence of English painting on French art in the nineteenth century.</p><p>Patrick Noon has been the Patrick and Aimee Butler Curator of Paintings and Modern Sculpture at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts since 1997.

She was vice president of English PEN and one of Britain&#39;s nine Companions of Literature. Ms. Bedford lived in London where she passed away in February 2006.Evelyn Waugh called her first novel, A Legacy (1956), "entirely delicious. . . . cool . . . elegant." To Bruce Chatwin, A Visit to Don Otavio (1953), her travel book about Mexico, was a model of the genre, not least because of its stylishly witty prose. Similarly, her account of a celebrated English murder case, The Trial of Dr. Adams (1958), set a new standard for true-crime reporting, even as her two-volume biography of Aldous Huxley (1973, 1974) remains the fullest and most enjoyable life of that polymath.<p>Born in 1911, Sybille Bedford is nearly the last great representative of those amusing and intelligently cosmopolitan women writers who came to prominence in 1950s Britain: Nancy Mitford, Barbara Pym, Iris Murdoch, Muriel Spark (still with us). She has written only four novels -- the others are A Favourite of the Gods (1962), A Compass Error (1968), and Jigsaw (1989) -- and all of them are, more or less, autobiographical. Again and again, she takes up her privileged family heritage (upper-class German, both Jewish and Catholic), her girlhood in France with a feckless art-connoisseur father, her adolescence in Italy with a beautiful, promiscuous mother, and her coming of age in Sanary on the C�te d'Azur, surrounded by eminent artists and writers (Thomas Mann and Huxley, above all), in the company of her restless Italian stepfather (15 years her mother's junior) and periodically exhilarated or wounded by heartbreaking infatuations.</p><p>In Quicksands, Bedford returns again to her seductive parents and gypsyish early years, but now forgoes all the convenient chutes and ladders of art. Instead she recalls episodes (more Jigsaw than A Legacy), in a jagged, semi-conversational mode, "an amalgam of fragments." As she announces at the opening, "I shall begin as I hope to continue: from the middle." Stendhal has long been one of Bedford's heroes, and her memoir possesses something of the same dynamic as that novelist's autobiographical Life of Henry Brulard. So Quicksands shifts constantly between the past and the present, between an older writer's interpretative understanding and a younger self's emotional experience. Like Stendhal, too, Bedford possesses a compassionate, autumnal view of the world, as well as a darting, quicksilver prose. She can be lyrical in her descriptions, but her intelligence is fundamentally dry, unblinkered, without illusion. In brief, she is what we Americans regard as a cultivated European, one who lives not for wealth or fame or power but for the petits plaisirs of life. As she says:</p><p>"Oh what has remained undone by sloth, discouragement, and of course distractions . . . Distractions of living the siren song of the daily round -- chance, often choice had led me to spend the squandered years in beautiful or interesting places: to learn, to see, to travel, to walk in nocturnal streets, swim in warm seas, make friends and keep them, eat on trellised terraces, drink wine under summer leaves, to hear the song of tree-frog and cicada, to fall in love . . . (Often. Too often)." </p><p>Quicksands covers, in its zigzagging between now and then, only the first 45 or so years of Bedford's life, roughly the first half of the past century. Essentially, she discusses the people who formed her imagination and mind; more circumspectly, those she loved. These last range from her adored father and mother, to the elegant Issa, who later collaborated with the Germans, and Huxley, whom she revered as a mentor, to Allanah Harper, who financially supported the novelist-in-training, to Evelyn Gendel, who one day murmured "the three fatal words" and on the next, simply moved in, abandoning a young husband. Along the way, Bedford also discusses lifelong eye troubles, a haphazard education in England, her passion for Quattrocento art, and her desperate measures to acquire a British passport, measures that culminated in a quickie marriage to a young man she seems never to have seen again. Still she made his last name her own, and then she made it famous.</p><p>Periodically, Bedford apologizes for going over material that has already appeared in her earlier books. And so I won't repeat yet again these same events (e.g., the cause and consequences of her mother's addiction to morphine). In truth, one reads Quicksands for the chance to be in touch with an urbane sensibility and to enjoy its prose and the worldly wisdom of its observations. Let me quote a few examples:</p><p>"She looks the kind of woman men fall for, young men, old men, the woman men do things for." </p><p>"My parents' marriage, the first part of which they spent in southern Spain which they only left because of my impending and unwelcome birth, did not last partly because of my mother's habit of falling seriously in love with another man every few years."</p><p>"One stayed of course on good terms with the concierges. Returning at daybreak you would be handed your key with a discreet, a very discreet, smile of approval. Such good relations were not engendered by a mere tip. You did tip, adequately mostly, not extravagantly, at the end of a week or in receipt of a parcel or message; what mattered was human comportment: mutual good manners, some pleasant talk, warmth. It is this rapport which comes naturally to Italians, which makes one feel belonging for an instant to the brotherhood of man."</p><p>A young German housemaid runs upstairs to the child Sybille: "Emerging from sleep, I heard, 'The Russians have surrendered to Germany . . . The war in Russia is over . . . !' 'I'm so glad,' I said. 'I hope your fianc� will be safe now.' The girl knelt down by my high bed and hugged me. You are a good child, she said, a kind child. At moments now when I am in distress about the many things which in the course of my life I said or left unsaid, or did or left undone, a recall of that night, so very far away in time, is consoling. Through that child's quick impulse I may have been accorded a grain, a very small grain, of absolution."</p><p>"Merano. A place I had not heard of. A prosperous, soign� resort in a benign climate, surrounded by orchards and vines, with blue skies and a luxuriant vegetation in well-kept parks and gardens with well-dressed middle-aged people on the garden-benches." </p><p>The great German art historian Julius Meier-Graefe settles in Sanary with "his very young fourth wife -- he had her elope with him straight from Swiss boarding school, pursued by telephone and police." After the art historian's premature death, "she specialized in famous writers and artists as well as Greek ship-owners -- concurrent with discreet affairs with one of their sons."</p><p>And so it goes. Alongside tales of adultery and addiction, of chicanery and betrayal, what remains in the reader's mind is the sense of Mediterranean ease, courtesy and dignity, of long periods given over to the sweetness of work one loves and of daily commerce with people one loves just as much. In particular, many of the most fascinating and intelligent women of our time appear in these pages -- Martha Gellhorn takes Bedford to Ischia; Virginia Woolf comes to her "wedding" supper; Mary McCarthy, Janet Flanner and Hannah Arendt attend her book party. The range of the Bedford memory is astonishing -- from the 19th-century Germany of her grandparents to the 21st-century world after Sept. 11. Periodically, she expresses a quite reasonable fear for mankind's future.</p><p>Though fragmented in structure and somewhat familiar in its elements (at least to Bedford readers), Quicksands is still a deeply ingratiating book, a chance to spend some time with a humane sensibility and to visit a now-vanished world. On the last page of what must likely be her last book, Bedford writes:</p><p>" 'Have another glass of wine?' they say. I don't think so. 'Why not? You might as well.' Perhaps I will." Wise readers will hurry to pull up a chair and join her for that drink. </p><p></p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

I struggled to, anyway: the decades-old dog-eared copy that I found at the back of my dad's bookcase had a loose monochrome cover that always wanted to come off in my hands. This was a link to his world as a scientist, and to what he did all day. (Actually, he was a research chemist, but what did I know.) More, the book was a glimpse of a world just as alien as those in the pages of my <i>2000 AD</i> comic, peopled with warlocks and genetic infantrymen. The pictures looked hand-drawn, and showed features on the outside of the creatures as well as their inner structures. I studied those pages and copied the drawings&#x2014;the stunning representation of the <i>Hydra</i> especially&#x2014;into my sketch pad, next to Rogue Trooper and Judge Dredd. <i>2000 AD</i> later published one of those drawings, but it was the fantastic stories of the true, hidden world of invertebrates that really fired my imagination.&#x201d; (David Adam <i>Nature</i>)</p><h2>Halibut Jackson</h2><p>A picture book about shyness from a new and truly innovative artist<br> <br> Halibut Jackson is shy. He would prefer not to be noticed at all. But he loves to make his own suits, especially suits that help <br> him blend into the background: He has a flowered suit for the park, a book-patterned suit for the library, and a fruit-adorned suit for the shops. But mostly he stays indoors. When Halibut's invited to a party at the palace, he's too bashful to go, until he decides to make a palace-patterned suit. "No one will even notice me!" he thinks. Except that it's a garden party . . . and <i>everyone</i> notices Halibut. Soon, he's the most popular guy in town, thanks to his skills with a needle and thread, and his fabulous fashion sense. <br> <br> This is a winning homage to shy people everywhere. Do you know a Halibut Jackson?</p><p>Quirky, sweet, and brilliantly illustrated, David Lucas' <i>Halibut Jackson</i>, has the makings of an instant classic. Parents and kids alike will love little Halibut with his penchant for wide brimmed hats and capes (ala <i>Madeline</i>) from the start--they just have to find him first.<p> Halibut Jackson is shy. He wants nothing more than to blend into the background--<i>any</i> background. In order to stay undercover, Halibut makes his own suits out of fabrics with convenient patterns: he saves the brick wall pattern for when he goes into town, the flower pattern for the park, and the book pattern for the library. So, when Queen invites Halibut to the Palace for a party, it is only natural for him to fashion an ornate and glittering suit to blend in with the Palace walls. Imagine his surprise when he realizes (too late) that it is a garden party! </p><p> Lucas balances the beautifully busy pages with simple, repetitive text complete with italics to help parents find the right tone: "Halibut Jackson was <i>shy</i>. Halibut Jackson didn't like to be noticed. Halibut Jackson liked to blend into the <i>background</i>." Parents will love Halibut Jackson for the art (each glorious spread is worthy of framing), and kids will not only identify with Halibut's shyness, but they'll be delighted to join the game of locating Halibut on each page. An artsy <i>Where's Waldo</i> for toddlers, Lucas' debut as author and illustrator has bright and playful watercolor illustrations that spill over the pages, encouraging kids to pore over every detail. With story and design elements reminiscent of <i>Madeline</i> and <i>Curious George</i>, <i>Halibut Jackson</i> promises to soon occupy happy children's bookshelves everywhere. Let's just hope that Lucas and Jackson are ready for all the attention. (Ages 4 to 9) <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>David Lucas studied illustration at the Royal College of Art.

Though this traditional distinction has begun to erode, the worlds of comics and art continue to occupy vastly different social spaces.</p><p><em>Comics Versus Art</em> examines the relationship between comics and the most important institutions of the art world, including museums, auction houses, and the art press. Bart Beaty's analysis centres around two questions: why were comics excluded from the history of art for most of the twentieth century, and what does it mean that comics production is now more closely aligned with the art world? Approaching this relationship for the first time through the lens of the sociology of culture, Beaty advances a completely novel approach to the comics form.</p></p><p><p><b>Bart Beaty</b> is a professor in the Department of English at the University of Calgary.</p><p><em>&#x201c;Comics Versus Art</em> is an intriguing text for readers of comics, and an illuminating look at the theoretical underpinnings of what we call &#x2013; and refuse to call &#x2013; art.&#x201d;</p> (Ian Daffern <i>Quill and Quire</i>)<br><br>&#x2018;This solid, sound, intriguing book will set the discourse on art and comics for a considerable time.

In this, the fifth installment, Brunetti sets out to investigate an assault on an American archeologist who herself is investigating a museum exhibition of Chinese antiquities. The moods of Venice and the reflections of the canny, emotional detective are the most affecting qualities of the book.<p>A New Yorker of Irish/Spanish descent, Donna Leon first went to Italy in 1965, returning regularly over the next decade or so while pursuing a career as an academic in the States and then later in Iran, China and finally Saudi Arabia. It was after a period in Saudi Arabia, which she found &#x2018;damaging physically and spiritually&#x2019; that Donna decided to move to Venice, where she has now lived for over twenty years.</p> <p>Her debut as a crime fiction writer began as a joke: talking in a dressing room in Venice&#x2019;s opera-house La Fenice after a performance, Donna and a singer friend were vilifying a particular German conductor.

The ambiguous relations between power and representation--whether in the form of Dutch colonial patrol notes from the 1930s, the sensationalized media accounts of the survivors of a downed U.S. army plane in &#34;Shangri-La&#34; from the 1940s or a tourist&#39;s snapshots from the 1990s--become visible in Meiselas&#39;s book, through both the contradictions and unexpected continuities of the gathered materials.</p><p></p><h2>Travels with myself and another</h2><p>A brilliantly witty and intelligent memoir of the adventures, discoveries, rescues, and narrow escapes of Martha Gellhorn, one of America's most important war correspondents and the third wife of Ernest Hemingway.<br><br>"Gellhorn is incapable of writing a dull sentence."<br>-<i>The Times</i> (London)<br><br>"Martha Gellhorn was so fearless in a male way, and yet utterly capable of making men melt," writes <i>New Yorker</i> literary editor Bill Buford.

With razor-sharp humor and exceptional insight into place and character, she tells of a tense week spent among dissidents in Moscow; long days whiled away in a disused water tank with hippies clustered at Eilat on the Red Sea; and her journeys by sampan and horse to the interior of China during the Sino-Japanese War.<br><br>Now including a foreward by Bill Buford and photographs of Gellhorn with Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Gary Cooper, and others, this new edition rediscovers the voice of an extraordinary woman and brings back into print an irresistibly entertaining classic.</p><p>Martha Gellhorn published five novels and seven prize-winning collections of her explosive journalism. Her career spanned several decades: She covered the 1937-38 war in Spain, sent dispatches from the front in World War II and followed the trail of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, and reported on the conflicts in Vietnam in 1966 and in Israel in 1967, Gellhorn died in 1998 at the age of eighty-nine.&#34;one of the funniest travel books of our time&#34; Dervla Murphy</p><h2>The First World War in the Middle East</h2><p>The First World War in the Middle East is an accessibly written military and social history of the clash of world empires in the Dardanelles, Egypt and Palestine, Mesopotamia, Persia and the Caucasus.

He broke bones with no memory of falling; he nearly lost his kidneys; he almost died from massive seizures during acute withdrawal. He gave up his flourishing practice and, fearing for his life, immersed himself in Alcoholics Anonymous, rehab, therapy, and a variety of medications. Nothing worked.&nbsp;So he did the only thing he could: he took his treatment into his own hands. Searching for a cure for his deadly disease, he happened upon baclofen, a muscle relaxant that had been used safely for years as a treatment for various types of muscle spasticity, but had more recently shown promising results in studies with laboratory animals addicted to a wide variety of substances. Dr. Ameisen prescribed himself the drug and experimented with increasingly higher dosages until he finally reached a level high enough to leave him free of <i>any </i>craving for alcohol. That was more than five years ago. &nbsp;Alcoholism claims three hundred lives per day in the United States alone; one in four U.S. deaths is attributable to alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs. Baclofen, as prescribed under a doctor&#x2019;s care, could possibly free many addicts from tragic and debilitating illness. But as long as the medical and research establishments continue to ignore a cure for one of the most deadly diseases in the world, we won&#x2019;t be able to understand baclofen&#x2019;s full addiction-treatment potential.&nbsp;<i>The End of My Addiction </i>is both a memoir of Dr. Ameisen&#x2019;s own struggle and a groundbreaking call to action&#x2014;an urgent plea for research that can rescue millions from the scourge of addiction and spare their loved ones the collateral damage of the disease.</p><p><b>Olivier Ameisen, MD</b>,&nbsp;inaugurated the position of official physician to the prime minister of France. He came to the United States in 1983 to join the prestigious cardiology team at New York Hospital and Cornell University Medical Center, where he became an associate professor of clinical medicine and an associate attending physician. He is currently Visiting Professor of Medicine at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.<p>1. Moment of Truth</p><p>I CAME TO MY SENSES and took stock of where I was: in a cab, with blood streaming down my face and spattering my trench coat. I looked out the window and in the glow of the streetlights saw the cab was on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, waiting for the light to change at 76th Street. The church on the corner reminded me it was Sunday, and I looked at my watch. It was almost midnight. The few people on the street were buttoned up against the late winter chill, but it was warm in the cab.</p><p>My apartment was not too far away, on East 63rd Street between York and First Avenues, but I needed medical attention. I asked the driver to take me to the emergency room at New York Hospital, at 68th Street and York Avenue. He seemed oblivious to my condition, and I wondered what had happened. Had the cab braked suddenly so that I hit my head, or had I been injured in some other way before I hailed it? I knew I&#x2019;d been drinking, but not where or how much.</p><p>As the cab pulled up in front of the hospital emergency room entrance, a memory of the evening began to come together. Around 8:30 p.m. I had visited my friend Jeff Steiner, the CEO of Fairchild Corporation, to ask his advice on running my cardiology practice, which I&#x2019;d started two and a half years before. I&#x2019;d been introduced to Jeff in the late 1980s by a mutual friend, another physician.</p><p>Although I&#x2019;d intended not to drink that evening, I felt insulted when Jeff&#x2019;s butler offered me a choice of teas. "Why doesn&#x2019;t he offer me an alcoholic drink as well at this hour?" I thought. "Is this a judgmental message?"</p><p>I asked for and drank a glass of Scotch, then made a show of declining a refill. Much later I learned that Jeff was not aware that I had been drinking heavily. He&#x2019;d known me only to have a few drinks at large parties, here and there, over the years. But my mounting concerns about my practice finances had changed that.</p><p>The standard expectation is that it will take a new medical practice two years to break even. Mine broke even in four months. And almost three years later, in March 1997, there it remained&#x2014; hovering a little over the break-even point.</p><p>Staggering into the emergency room, I thought, "They will see I&#x2019;m drunk. That&#x2019;s not so good. But at least I know the place is well run and will fix me up right." I had been associated with New York Hospital and its partner institution, Cornell University Medical College,* ever since I arrived from France in the fall of 1983 to do research and clinical fellowships in cardiology. Thirteen and a half years later, I was a clinical associate professor</p><p>*As the two institutions were then known; in 1998 they became New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College.</p><p>of medicine at Cornell and an associate attending physician at New York Hospital, in addition to running my private practice.</p><p>Inside the emergency room, I passed out again. When I came to, one of my ex-students, Matt, now a resident, was standing over me preparing to stitch the wound in my forehead. So as not to be left with a scar, I asked him to use Steri-Strips instead. He did and then left me to lie quietly for a few hours so I could sober up enough to walk home safely. He was plainly even more embarrassed to treat me in my drunken state than I was to need treatment. I cringed at the thought of my appearance in the ER being discussed around the hospital, then pushed the thought out of my mind. Matt was not the kind of person to talk about it; that was some comfort.</p><p>Lying there, I ran the video of the evening in my mind. "Run the video of what happens when you drink" was something I&#x2019;d been hearing in Alcoholics Anonymous, where I was still very much a newcomer.</p><p>My conversation with Jeff Steiner had been frustrating for us both. Although he was eager to help, there was a mismatch between his expertise and my problems. What I really needed was a small business adviser, not a big corporate dealmaker.</p><p>As I left Jeff&#x2019;s apartment, my mind whirled with conflicting thoughts. My cost-blind practice style might function better in France&#x2019;s universal health care system than in the United States, I thought, and I wondered if I should relocate back to Paris, where I was from. But I loved my life in New York. In 1991 I had acquired U.S. citizenship, and it pleased me to be a citizen of a country with so many shared ideals with my country of origin. If not profitable, my practice was at least busy and my work enormously rewarding. My patient roster included wealthy andcelebrated people along with Harlem church ladies on Medicare or Medicaid and the indigent, and I liked that mix. And my social life was wonderfully stimulating&#x2014;more so than I could imagine having anywhere else. No, I wasn&#x2019;t eager to leave.</p><p>But my practice could not continue indefinitely at this rate, and the constant anxiety created by financial worries was growing into a source of full-blown panic. I struggled with a deep sense of failure, and I lived in fear that the world would see that my accomplishments were nothing but a sham, a house of cards that could collapse at any second.</p><p>This was not a new feeling to me. Throughout my life I had been plagued by anxious feelings of inadequacy, of being an impostor on the brink of being unmasked. I had been seeing therapists for a long time before I started drinking. To be honest, they never were much help with my anxiety. Nor was the Xanax they prescribed me.</p><p>The one Scotch at Jeff&#x2019;s made me aware of how thirsty I was. I went to a Chinese restaurant, intending to have a meal as well, but wound up eating nothing and drinking one double vodka after another. And then . . . I found myself bleeding in the taxicab.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t my first blackout drinking. But the blackouts were getting more common, whole stretches of evenings expunged from my memory. And this was the first time I&#x2019;d come out of a blackout with a physical injury. Until then blackouts had only been sources of intense mortification as I wondered what embarrassing things I might have said or done.</p><p>The next morning I thought briefly about amusing tales I could concoct to explain the bandages on my forehead. Decidingthat I was too hungover to go to work, I had my office assistant reschedule the day&#x2019;s patients. As my drinking had increased, I had scrupulously honored my first duty as a doctor&#x2014;to do no harm. I stopped driving. And I never set foot in my office or the hospital when I was not completely sober.</p><p>Still, I resisted seeing myself as a problem drinker. All I really needed, I thought, was to learn to drink better. This delusion was encouraged by a well-meaning friend and an equally well-meaning but I think even more misguided therapist, both of whom undertook to show me how to be a moderate wine drinker rather than a binger on Scotch or vodka. I even began AA with the thought that it might give me tips on managing my drinking better rather than stopping completely.</p><p>Not everyone thought I was a candidate for moderation. The two friends who escorted me to my first meeting didn&#x2019;t think so. One was a longtime AA member, a poet and a writer and a very beautiful woman who looked a bit like Katharine Hepburn. She used to say, "I want you to see me before I lose my looks." She still has those looks today. When we met, she had been sober for many years, yet she told me, "I am an alcoholic." That struck me as very strange, and I was embarrassed to hear her say it. People with diabetes or hypertension didn&#x2019;t identify themselves by their illnesses. Why should people with alcoholism?</p><p>Of course, I thought that because I did not want to admit&#x2014; to myself or anyone else&#x2014;that I might be alcohol-dependent. And so I was terrified to go to a meeting. But my friends each took me by an arm, and escorted me from my apartment on East 63rd Street to the major AA meeting place in the neighborhood&#x2014; the 79th Street Workshop, in the basement of St. Monica&#x2019;s Catholic Church, on 79th Street between York and First Avenues. Itwas my first step, taken reluctantly, toward facing my illness. But it was a vital one.</p><p>It is hard for everyone who attends AA to get past the potential embarrassment of being seen as an alcoholic. Shortly before I went to AA for the first time, my shrink began encouraging me to go. I said, "What about anonymity? My office and my apartment are right in the same neighborhood. What if a patient or somebody else I know sees me?"</p><p>He said, "Don&#x2019;t worry. Anyone inside will be an alcoholic and won&#x2019;t say anything."</p><p>"But what if a colleague sees me entering or leaving the place?"</p><p>"It won&#x2019;t happen."</p><p>It did happen. But after I started going to AA, I told him, "AA is a great place. Have you been to a meeting?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"You refer people. Maybe you should know what it&#x2019;s like. Will you come with me to an open meeting?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because somebody might see me."</p><p>There is a moral stigma to addiction, and it is prospective shame that drives people to resist admitting they have a problem. It leads physicians to miss or delay a diagnosis of addiction, too. Only a couple of months earlier, I had brought up AA in a session with my shrink. "Oh, you&#x2019;re not an alcoholic," he said dismis-sively, "but you could become one." Then he changed the subject away from alcohol and drinking.</p><p>Later on in my alcoholism, when I knew more about the course of the illness, I wondered how he could have missed the signs of its onset in me, and could even have turned a deaf ear to my first outright call for help. The responses of my physician colleagues at New York Hospital&#x2013;Cornell puzzled me, too. When I would discreetly ask around about how to help "someone" with a drinking problem, they&#x2019;d ask, "Is the person close to you?"</p><p>If I said no, they&#x2019;d say, "You don&#x2019;t want to get involved. It&#x2019;s a minefield."</p><p>If yes, "Well, I really don&#x2019;t know w...</p></p><h2>The Animus: The Spirit of Inner Truth in Women (Polarities of the Psyche)</h2><p>Barbara Hannah was a straightforward, modest, yet a grand woman, a lover of literature, and a colleague and friend of C.&nbsp;G. Jung, Emma Jung, and Marie-Louise von Franz. A first-generation Jungian psychologist, she was an original member of the Psychological Club of Zurich and a founder of the Jung Institute in Zurich. She lectured extensively in Switzerland and England and wrote several books on C.&nbsp;G. Jung and Jungian psychology. <p> <b><i>The Animus</i></b>, in two volumes, presents a psychological analysis of the animus, gleaned from handwritten notes, typed manuscripts, previously published articles, the author's own drafts of her lectures, and notes taken by those present. Barbara Hannah tackled the theme of the animus with a comprehensiveness unsurpassed in Jungian literature. Her insights and vigor stem from personally grappling with her own animus, while integrating the experience and reflections of many psychotherapists who worked directly with C.&nbsp;G. Jung. </p><p> Authenticity and comprehensiveness were priorities in editing this work, as well as the preservation of the excellence and comprehensiveness of her work on the animus&#x2015;a most complex and vexing topic&#x2015;while retaining the wonderfully natural spirit of Barbara Hannah herself. </p><p> Themes include the case of the sixteenth-century nun, Jeanne Fery; the animus in the Book of Tobit (or Tobias); literature generally (the Bront�s in particular); and the meaning of the animus for modern women. </p><p> See also: <b><i>The Animus</i></b>, volume 1.

Covering all types of American and Canadian barns and everything associated with them-implements and tools, hex signs, silos, out buildings, hinges, barn raising, and more-&#34;Eric Sloane&#39;s An Age of Barns&#34; is a spectacular album tribute to this important facet of our architecture and agriculture. This book is sure to once again become a collector&#39;s item.</p><p>Eric Sloane, formerly of Connecticut, was a famous American painter, illustrator, and author who published more than 40 books, including &#34;Diary of an Early American Boy and Museum of Tools.&#34;An unfortunate result of progress is that many older technologies or styles are lost to future generations. With preservation in mind, Sloane created the original edition of this title, which has been out of print for 20 years. This reissue is of great value to anyone interested in barns or early Americana. The black-and-white illustrations are simply beautiful, showing the amazing array of barn designs and related agricultural buildings. Sloane also covers barn raisings, smoke houses, and the specific parts of all of these structures. This remarkable book will appeal to those interested in construction, Americana, or rural living; this title should be part of every public library collection. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Captain&#39;s Blood (Star Trek)</h2><p>When Ambassador Spock is assassinated during a Romulan peace rally, a retired James T.

His own heart, now, he knew.</p> <p>Dying.</p> <p>It was the way of things.</p> <p>No matter that logic had so many times been circumvented. No matter that fate and luck and James T. Kirk had so many times intervened in the flow of cause and effect; inevitably everything must die.</p> <p>Vulcans were no exception.</p> <p>"Mister Ambassador?"</p> <p>Spock opened his eyes. Meditation eluded him.</p> <p>Even in the shadows of the ground transport's passenger compartment, lit only by the slow green flicker of passing streetglows, he saw the worry in Marinta's expression. Romulans were so free that way. In truth, there was much these lost children could teach their Vulcan forebears.</p> <p>Spock focused his thoughts on chance -- his one last chance to make that transfer possible.</p> <p>Reunification.</p> <p>It was all that mattered to him now.</p> <p>"We're almost there," Marinta said.</p> <p>Spock knew that wasn't what she meant.</p> <p>"I am fine," he assured her.</p> <p>Marinta smiled. "I don't believe you."</p> <p>Spock raised an eyebrow at the young woman with whom he had worked for almost half a standard year, ever since the dark days of confusion following Shinzon's coup and the slaughter of almost every member of the Romulan Senate. He had no reason to question Marinta's loyalty to his cause of reuniting Vulcans and Romulans after more than two millennia of bitter estrangement. But the respect he had reluctantly come to accept as his natural due as a senior Vulcan ambassador was something she seldom demonstrated. Spock decided it was that refreshing freedom from formality he appreciated most about her.</p> <p>After more than a century and a half of life lived within the protective cloak of total logic and emotional self-control, Spock craved freedom.</p> <p>That craving drove him now. Just as he recognized that the war between his two halves -- human and Vulcan -- had once dominated him before he had achieved his own unique balance. But now that same struggle still continued, unresolved, between the Vulcans and the Romulans. Only the scale was different.</p> <p>Spock's personal battle ended decades ago, when V'Ger had come to claim the Earth, though the scars of that victory would be with him forever.</p> <p>Now he wanted -- he <i>needed</i> -- to bring the same peace of acceptance to his chosen people. That same freedom.</p> <p>Before he died.</p> <p>"You're doing the right thing." Marinta spoke quietly, as if she sensed his thoughts. Being Romulan, it was entirely possible that she did. Vulcan telepathic traits were encoded in Romulan and Reman DNA, and not always dormant.</p> <p>"That is not in question."</p> <p>"I sense your doubt."</p> <p>"Not doubt," Spock answered. Then surprised even himself with his confession. "Remorse."</p> <p>Through the dark windows of the transport, Spock watched as the ancient stone streets of Primedian scrolled by, rough-hewn, black as space, overlaid with centuries of urban soot. And in the shadowed intervals between pools of pale green light, reflected in those same dark windows he glimpsed the faces of the dead.</p> <p>Lieutenant Latimer. Pierced by an alien spear.</p> <p>Lieutenant Gaetano. Crushed by alien hands.</p> <p>Both of them dead and buried on Taurus II.</p> <p>Because of him.</p> <p>"There is no need for remorse," Marinta said.</p> <p>He looked back at her. "Still, it exists."</p> <p>Marinta's dark eyes flashed. "Mister Ambassador, I submit that reaction is not logical."</p> <p>But Spock caught the smile she tried to suppress and unexpectedly found himself doing the same. No one else he knew these days, at least not under the age of one hundred fifty, would dare take him on in logical debate. "That is not the issue. Remorse is an emotion. Logic plays no part."</p> <p>"I thought you believed logic plays a part in...everything."</p> <p>"The words 'logic' and 'believe' do not often belong in the same sentence."</p> <p>"Then what you are about to do," she said slowly, "does it flow from logic, or belief?" Marinta, despite her brave challenge to him, sounded confused. Spock couldn't blame her. If he allowed his own constrained emotions to surface, he knew he would betray the same hesitation.</p> <p>Spock kept his face neutral, his lined features more akin to carved stone than flesh. But with his stark words, his heart, his memories escaped all shielding.</p> <p>"I once commanded a shuttlecraft crew. The <i>Columbus</i>. Our mission: to investigate a quasarlike object. We were forced down. There were seven of us when we crash-landed. Only five survived to return to the <i>Enterprise</i>."</p> <p>Marinta was quick to form a conclusion. By telepathy or insight, it didn't matter. She was correct either way.</p> <p>"That's why you feel remorse. For the loss of those two crew members."</p> <p>"They were my responsibility. They were not the first to die under my command. Nor the last. But they are the two I remember most clearly."</p> <p>"Because...?"</p> <p>Spock glanced out the windows again. The transport was slowing. Like a failing heartbeat.</p> <p>"They died while I attempted to lead by logic. I, and the others, survived only when I set logic aside." Spock again surprised himself. Though Doctor McCoy had speculated on the motivation behind Spock's decision at the time of the incident, this was the first time Spock had confessed it aloud.</p> <p>Uncharacteristically, Marinta offered no comment or judgment, as if waiting for him to continue. But Spock said nothing more.</p> <p>The transport stopped and Spock felt it settle slowly as its wheels withdrew. In this most ancient of Romulan cities, where the planners of the central streets and plazas had been among the first outcast Vulcans to land on this world, old technologies were a tradition.</p> <p>Spock pulled his ambassadorial robes close. They were lighter than those he usually wore, since he had forgone the traditional jewels and silver embroidery of his office. Spock had no desire to stand apart from his cousins. Much of Rom-ulus was still impoverished in the aftermath of the Dominion War, harsh conditions made worse by Shinzon and the subsequent disruption of government services.</p> <p>He rewarded Marinta's quiet patience.</p> <p>"After repairs, the <i>Columbus</i> achieved a decaying orbit. We had, at best, almost an hour before we were forced down again. I chose to ignite all our fuel at once. Not for propulsion, but as a signal. One with little chance of being detected. A signal that meant the <i>Columbus</i> would burn up in minutes."</p> <p>Spock again felt the heat of that terrible moment. The buffeting of the thickening atmosphere. The acrid bite of burning insulation as the temperature rose. The unspoken accusations of his crew. The approach of death.</p> <p>"But obviously the signal was detected," Marinta said.</p> <p>Spock drew a breath, dispelled the past. "The signal was detected." He sat forward in his seat as he waited for the armored compartment door to be opened by the bodyguards outside. "And now I am preparing to commit the same act of desperation. To ignite all the fuel, as it were." He held Marinta's gaze. "It is not logical. But I <i>believe</i> it is my last best hope."</p> <p>"<i>Our</i> best hope." Marinta's bright smile was undisguised.</p> <p>Spock nodded. "For both our people. One people."</p> <p>The door puffed out, then hummed as it slid open.</p> <p>Primedian's night air was cold, unusual for the season. The musty, layered scent of age enveloped Spock, and for a stifling moment he felt as ancient as the city's weathered blocks and roadways.</p> <p>Two private bodyguards -- Romulan, in drab and featureless civilian garb -- stood outside, their stern features harshly shadowed emerald by a single, overhead streetglow that shone straight down. Each guard had a microcommunicator in one pointed ear. Narrow disruptor tubes in magnetic holsters were strapped to their forearms, their outlines almost concealed by the fabric of their sleeves.</p> <p>"It's time," Spock said, to himself as much as to anyone else.</p> <p>But Marinta reached out and lightly placed her hand on a fold of his robes, taking care not to touch his arm. "Mister Ambassador..."</p> <p>Spock looked at her, waited.</p> <p>"The shuttlecraft. I've read so many accounts of your life. It wasn't the <i>Columbus</i>. It was the <i>Galileo</i>."</p> <p>In defiance of his self-mastery, Spock felt his stomach tighten. She was right. <i>How could I have forgotten? Have I grown so old?</i></p> <p>"Of course," he said calmly, fiercely walling off anything he thought, anything he felt. He had commanded the <i>Galileo</i>, not the <i>Columbus</i>. "I misspoke."</p> <p>If Marinta sensed anything of his inward struggle, she did not share it with him.</p> <p>She merely took her hand from his robes. "I'll...wait for you here?"</p> <p>"That would be best."</p> <p>Saying nothing else, Spock stepped from the transport, into the night, into what must happen next.</p> <p>But his lapse of memory tore at him, spurring the unwanted memories of heat and smoke and...</p> <p>He saw two figures in an alley. Dead eyes locked on his in bitter accusation.</p> <p>Latimer and Gaetano, both in their antique uniforms. Sodden with fresh blood.</p> <p>Spock's guards saw his reaction, spun together, disruptors already in their hands as they aimed across the street at...</p> <p>The empty alley.</p> <p>Like burrowing snakes, the disruptors slipped back up the guards' sleeves.</p> <p>"Did you see something, Mister Ambassador?"</p> <p>Spock answered by walking toward the private entrance to the towering coliseum, robes swirling around his boots.</p> <p>The bodyguards hurried to match his pace.</p> <p>No sign of what Spock felt or thought was visible in his demeanor.</p> <p>But within, he was consumed by doubt and felt the first insinuating tendrils of what any human would recognize as panic.</p> <p>His decision had been made. His path could not be altered any more than a decaying orbit could escape the siren call of gravity.</p> <p>But he had commanded the <i>Galileo</i>, not the <i>Columbus</i>.</p> <p>And just as he was haunted by the mistakes he had made in the past, he feared the mistakes that still remained before him, and already felt remorse for those who could be harmed because what he must do next might somehow be wrong.</p> <p>Consumed by doubt, displaying confidence, Sp...</p></p><h2>The Beatrix Potter Needlepoint Book</h2><p>Teaches how to create classic needlepoint designs inspired by Beatrix Potter&#39;s flora, fauna, and natural history illustrations, including patterns, photographs, and instructions for making slip covers, curtains, rugs, and other items</p><p></p><h2>The Idea of the Vernacular: An Anthology of Middle English Literary Theory, 1280&#x2013;1520</h2><p><p>This pioneering anthology of Middle English prologues and other excerpts from texts written between 1280 and 1520 is one of the largest collections of vernacular literary theory from the Middle Ages yet published and the first to focus attention on English literary theory before the sixteenth century.

Friedman's No. 1 bestseller The World Is Flat has helped millions of readers to see globalization in a new way. Now Friedman brings a fresh outlook to the crises of destabilizing climate change and rising competition for energy-both of which could poison our world if we do not act quickly and collectively. His argument speaks to all of us who are concerned about the state of America in the global future. Friedman proposes that an ambitious national strategy- which he calls "Geo-Greenism"-is not only what we need to save the planet from overheating; it is what we need to make America healthier, richer, more innovative, more productive, and more secure. As in The World Is Flat, he explains a new era-the Energy-Climate era-through an illuminating account of recent events. He shows how 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the flattening of the world by the Internet (which brought 3 billion new consumers onto the world stage) have combined to bring climate and energy issues to Main Street. But they have not gone very far down Main Street; the much-touted "green revolution" has hardly begun. With all that in mind, Friedman sets out the clean-technology breakthroughs we, and the world, will need; he shows that the ET (Energy Technology) revolution will be both transformative and disruptive; and he explains why America must lead this revolution-with the first Green President and a Green New Deal, spurred by the Greenest Generation. Hot, Flat, and Crowded&nbsp;is classic Thomas L. Friedman-fearless, incisive, forward-looking, and rich in surprising common sense about the world we live in today.</p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> <p>Thomas L. Friedman&#x2019;s phenomenal number-one bestseller <em>The World Is Flat </em>has helped millions of readers to see the world in a new way. In his brilliant, essential new book, Friedman takes a fresh and provocative look at two of the biggest challenges we face today: America&#x2019;s surprising loss of focus and national purpose since 9/11; and the global environmental crisis, which is affecting everything from food to fuel to forests. In this groundbreaking account of where we stand now, he shows us how the solutions to these two big problems are linked--how we can restore the world and revive America at the same time.</p> <p>Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the astonishing expansion of the world&#x2019;s middle class through globalization have produced a planet that is &#x201c;hot, flat, and crowded.&#x201d; Already the earth is being affected in ways that threaten to make it dangerously unstable. In just a few years, it will be too late to fix things--unless the United States steps up now and takes the lead in a worldwide effort to replace our wasteful, inefficient energy practices with a strategy for clean energy, energy efficiency, and conservation that Friedman calls Code Green.</p> <p>This is a great challenge, Friedman explains, but also a great opportunity, and one that America cannot afford to miss. Not only is American leadership the key to the healing of the earth; it is also our best strategy for the renewal of America.</p> <p>In vivid, entertaining chapters, Friedman makes it clear that the green revolution we need is like no revolution the world has seen. It will be the biggest innovation project in American history; it will be hard, not easy; and it will change everything from what you put into your car to what you see on your electric bill. But the payoff for America will be more than just cleaner air. It will inspire Americans to something we haven&#x2019;t seen in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, boldness, and concern for the common good that are our nation&#x2019;s greatest natural resources.</p> <p><em>Hot, Flat, and Crowded</em> is classic Thomas L. Friedman: fearless, incisive, forward-looking, and rich in surprising common sense about the challenge--and the promise--of the future.</p> <p><strong> Thomas Friedman and Fareed Zakaria: Author One-to-One</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Fareed Zakaria</strong>: Your book is about two things, the climate crisis and also about an American crisis. Why do you link the two?&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Thomas Friedman</strong>: You're absolutely right--it is about two things. The book says, America has a problem and the world has a problem. The world's problem is that it's getting hot, flat and crowded and that convergence--that perfect storm--is driving a lot of negative trends. America's problem is that we've lost our way--we've lost our groove as a country. And the basic argument of the book is that we can solve our problem by taking the lead in solving the world's problem.<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: Explain what you mean by "hot, flat and crowded."<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: There is a convergence of basically three large forces: one is global warming, which has been going on at a very slow pace since the industrial revolution; the second--what I call the flattening of the world--is a metaphor for the rise of middle-class citizens, from China to India to Brazil to Russia to Eastern Europe, who are beginning to consume like Americans. That's a blessing in so many ways--it's a blessing for global stability and for global growth. But it has enormous resource complications, if all these people--whom you've written about in your book, <em>The Post American World</em>--begin to consume like Americans. And lastly, global population growth simply refers to the steady growth of population in general, but at the same time the growth of more and more people able to live this middle-class lifestyle. Between now and 2020, the world's going to add another billion people. And their resource demands--at every level--are going to be enormous. I tell the story in the book how, if we give each one of the next billion people on the planet just one sixty-watt incandescent light bulb, what it will mean: the answer is that it will require about 20 new 500-megawatt coal-burning power plants. That's so they can each turn on just one light bulb!<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: In my book I talk about the "rise of the rest" and about the reality of how this rise of new powerful economic nations is completely changing the way the world works. Most everyone's efforts have been devoted to Kyoto-like solutions, with the idea of getting western countries to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. But I grew to realize that the West was a sideshow. India and China will build hundreds of coal-fire power plants in the next ten years and the combined carbon dioxide emissions of those new plants alone are five times larger than the savings mandated by the Kyoto accords. What do you do with the Indias and Chinas of the world?<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: I think there are two approaches. There has to be more understanding of the basic unfairness they feel. They feel like we sat down, had the hors d'oeuvres, ate the entr�e, pretty much finished off the dessert, invited them for tea and coffee and then said, "Let's split the bill." So I understand the big sense of unfairness--they feel that now that they have a chance to grow and reach with large numbers a whole new standard of living, we're basically telling them, "Your growth, and all the emissions it would add, is threatening the world's climate." At the same time, what I say to them--what I said to young Chinese most recently when I was just in China is this: Every time I come to China, young Chinese say to me, "Mr. Friedman, your country grew dirty for 150 years. Now it's our turn." And I say to them, "Yes, you're absolutely right, it's your turn. Grow as dirty as you want. Take your time. Because I think we probably just need about five years to invent all the new clean power technologies you're going to need as you choke to death, and we're going to come and sell them to you. And we're going to clean your clock in the next great global industry. So please, take your time. If you want to give us a five-year lead in the next great global industry, I will take five. If you want to give us ten, that would be even better. In other words, I know this is unfair, but I am here to tell you that in a world that's hot, flat and crowded, ET--energy technology--is going to be as big an industry as IT--information technology. Maybe even bigger. And who claims that industry--whose country and whose companies dominate that industry--I think is going to enjoy more national security, more economic security, more economic growth, a healthier population, and greater global respect, for that matter, as well. So you can sit back and say, it's not fair that we have to compete in this new industry, that we should get to grow dirty for a while, or you can do what you did in telecommunications, and that is try to leap-frog us. And that's really what I'm saying to them: this is a great economic opportunity. The game is still open. I want my country to win it--I'm not sure it will.<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: I'm struck by the point you make about energy technology. In my book I'm pretty optimistic about the United States. But the one area where I'm worried is actually ET. We do fantastically in biotech, we're doing fantastically in nanotechnology. But none of these new technologies have the kind of system-wide effect that information technology did. Energy does. If you want to find the next technological revolution you need to find an industry that transforms everything you do. Biotechnology affects one critical aspect of your day-to-day life, health, but not all of it. But energy--the consumption of energy--affects every human activity in the modern world. Now, my fear is that, of all the industries in the future, that's the one where we're not ahead of the pack. Are we going to run second in this race?<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: Well, I want to ask you that, Fareed. Why do you think we haven't led this industry, which itself has huge technological implications? We have all the secret sauce, all the technological prowess, to lead this industry. Why do you think this is the one area--and it's enormous, it's actually going to dwarf all the others--where we haven't been at the real cutting edge?<br><br></p> <strong>Continue reading the Q&amp;A between Thomas Friedman and Fareed Zakaria</strong> <br> <br><p><b>Thomas L.

Her history is filled with plagues, wars, duels, and murders ...no wonder every site in Savannah has a haunted past! <br>For over one year author James Caskey pored over the files at Georgia Historical Society researching the history of over 45 Savannah locations. The result is a collection of strange but rich historical accounts, which form the foundation for stories of actual experiences and sightings in these locations. <br><i>Haunted Savannah</i> brings you chilling tales, <i>as experienced and told by witnesses,</i> and authentic photos documenting the existence of energy from another dimension.</p><p>The owner and operator of Savannah's most popular walking tour, Jamie Caskey is also the author of the bestselling local guide, <i>Haunted Savannah.</i> A graduate of the Savannah College of Art and Design, Jamie is also a gifted painter. But living in the Victorian section of America's Most Haunted City practically forced this Florida transplant into taking a closer look at that which most people would prefer not to see at all: ghosts! <br>Jamie's research into Savannah's haunted history and his own personal experiences with the paranormal have made him a popular speaker whenever ghost hunters in need of a competent guide convene. His facts and findings have been featured on the Travel Channel, and he can be seen narrating a new series for PBS, Southern Haunts. Jamie is regularly featured in the Savannah Morning News and the local weekly Connect Savannah, and is routinely mentioned by travel writers in major newspapers, including the New York Daily News. <br>That Jamie dresses in period costume while conducting his highly informative and entertaining tour is not the mere affectation of an art student; Jamie's other passion is historical re-enactment, with an emphasis on the Civil War. He took part in the color guard that escorted the crew of the Confederate blockade runner Hunley from their watery grave to a more permanent resting place."One cannot walk down Savannah's streets at twilight without feeling evidence of her supernatural side. The old beautiful homes practically emanate the aura of lost loves, lives cut short, and other misfortunes." Thus begins James Caskey's "Haunted Savannah," the latest entry in the growing list of books about the city. I suspect many of you know Caskey, at least by sight. He's a tour guide and founder of Cobblestone Tours, and many nights he's dressed in Civil War Era garb while leading a group of visitors on his Savannah Haunted History Tour. Such tours have become a big hit with tourists who otherwise find little to do downtown at night. His new book, published by the locally based Bonaventure Books, is the official guide to the tour, and it's chock full of history, legends, stories, and personalities. The 200-plus page book is broken up into literally scores of readable small chapters. I suspect many local readers will find themselves reading the book as I did - by flipping through and randomly reading stories about places that interest us. Some of the places are familiar - The Olde Pink House, 17Hundred90, the Kehoe House. Other stories are less familiar, like the one about the Willink House on St. Julian, where mysterious goings-on might be linked to a clandestine school for blacks in the decade before Emancipation. Or the story of Irish immigrant Alice Riley, who was the first person to be executed in Georgia. She was hanged for murder in January of 1735. In addition to the stories about ghosts and other hauntings, the book is sprinkled with tales about the strange and notorious. Last weekend, "Haunted Savannah" was fittingly launched with a big party in the basement at Moon River Brewing Co. Originally the old City Hotel, the ancient building allegedly has hauntings of its own, and the close confines and dense brickwork of the basement appropriately evoked Savannah's mysterious past. And present. "Haunted Savannah" is available at bookstores and gift shops throughout downtown. --billdawers@comcast.net for Savannah Morning News<br><br>IT SEEMS LIKE everyone wants to live in a haunted house in Savannah. "It's almost a status symbol," says James Caskey, tour guide, historic re-enactor and author of the new book,<i> Haunted Savannah.</i> "Old seaports have that reputation," Caskey says.

"One woman drove in from Pooler to meet me," he says with surprise. Caskey moved to Savannah 13 years ago to attend the Savannah College of Art and Design to study painting. At that time, he did not believe in ghosts. "Then I took a job at the Fort Screven Inn on Tybee Island," Caskey says. "The owner warned me it was haunted, but I didn't believe in it at all. I thought he was a little off." Then Caskey began to hear strange noises in the hallway -- the sound of heavy boots walking, even though there was no one there. He blamed the sounds on the settling of an old building. There was a door leading down to the basement that was always kept locked, yet often while Caskey was doing his daily duties, he would find the door unlocked. One time, he locked it and turned to walk away, only to hear the door unlock behind him. Still, Caskey wasn't convinced, so he locked the door and backed down the hallway so he could watch the bolt. It didn't move, so he walked back to the door. As he reached for the knob to test it, the lock unlocked itself. <br> To write the book, Caskey conducted several lengthy interviews. I spent a lot of time with the people who own these haunted buildings, he says. Tourists often share their personal ghost stories with him during the walking tours. I have found people from all over who have ghost stories, Caskey says. Some have had frightening things happen that they don t understand. The tours began as an outgrowth of Caskey s interest in history and his fascination with Savannah. I don t know what ghosts are, Caskey says. I do know there is something out there because I ve experienced it. It s something we can t explain with science yet. Savannah deserves its reputation as America s Most Haunted City, Caskey says. It would be hard to imagine any others as haunted as us. --Linda Sickler for Connect Savannah</p><h2>Bech Is Back</h2><p>Seven new installments in the peripatetic life of the Jewish-American writer, Henry Bech, catch him in several aesthetic embarrassments as he travels to several third-world countries, turns fifty, marries, falls in love, and writes a best-selling book</p><p>Henry Bech is now fifty years old.

Influential Christian writer and speaker Os Guinness makes a passionate plea to put an end to the polarization of American politics and culture that&#x2014;rather than creating a public space for real debate&#x2014;threatens to reverse the very principles our founders set into motion and that have long preserved liberty, diversity, and unity in this country. </p><p>Guinness takes on the contemporary threat of the excesses of the Religious Right and the secular Left, arguing that we must find a middle ground between privileging one religion over another <em>and</em> attempting to make all public expression of faith illegal. If we do not do this, Guinness contends, Western civilization as we know it will die. Always provocative and deeply insightful, Guinness puts forth a vision of a new, practical "civil and cosmopolitan public square" that speaks not only to America's immediate concerns but to the long-term interests of the republic and the world. </p></p><p>&#x201c;How do we live with our deepest differences, especially when those differences are religious and ideological?&#x201d; The place to begin to search for answers is the United States. Not because the problem is worse here than elsewhere--on the contrary--but because America has the best resources, and therefore the greatest responsibility to point the way in answering the deepest questions. The Case For Civility is a proposal for restoring civility in America, as one model for fostering civility around the world and helping to make a world safe for diversity.<br> <br> Guinness makes a passionate plea to put an end to the culture wars that--rather than creating a public space for real debate--threaten to reverse the very principles our founders set into motion that have long preserved liberty, diversity, and unity in this country. Guinness argues that we must:<br> �Say &#x201c;No!&#x201d; to the sacred public square-we cannot privilege one religion over another; the Christian Right has it wrong<br> �Say &#x201c;No!&#x201d; to the naked public square-public expressions of faith must remain legal; intolerance in the name of tolerance by the secular left is equally wrongheaded <br> <br> The world is watching how Americans behave and, in the eyes of the world, we are failing to live up to our own ideals. Rich with historical anecdotes that unlock the genius of the American experiment, Guinness also takes on the contemporary threat of both the religious right and the secular left to construct a new way forward in the midst of the buildup to the Fall 2008 presidential elections.<p>Os Guinness, an author and social critic, has written or edited more than twenty-five books, including <em>The Call</em>, <em>Long Journey Home</em>, <em>Unspeakable</em>, and <em>The American Hour</em>. A frequent speaker and seminar leader at political and business conferences in the United States, Europe, and Asia, Guinness has lectured at many of the world's leading universities and has often spoken on Capitol Hill.

Was it a physical representation of a secret underground life he was living as a London businessman with two families? In this work of historical detection, the authors reconstruct a century of controversy surrounding the Cavendish-Benticks, culminating in one of the most bizarre and publicized cases the British courts have ever seen. A man steeped in layers of deliberately manufactured mystery, the fifth Duke of Portland&#x2014;unmarried and childless&#x2014;started life as Lord John Bentick, became the Marquess of Tichfield upon the suspicious death of his elder brother, and passed on his title to a cousin when he perished in 1879. But some claimed that he had forged a second identity as Thomas Druce, owner of the Baker Street Bazaar and subject of countless rumors about his secretive lifestyle throughout British high society. Druce allegedly died in 1864, but his burial produced suspicion when it was claimed his coffin was filled with lead rather than a corpse. When Druce's daughter-in-law surmised that he might have survived for 15 more years, she set out to shake the foundations of British society by proving that her son, Sidney Druce, was the rightful heir to the dukedom. In a legal battle straight out of Alice in Wonderland&#x2014;with accusations of madness, perjury, and even grave robbing&#x2014;the previously unassailable aristocratic establishment threatened to topple. The Disappearing Duke is a most extraordinary and improbable tale that will delight history buffs, mystery lovers, Anglophiles, and anyone who delights in the absurd. An index with sources is included.</p><p>When, in the early 19th century, the fourth duke of Portland informed his sons that owing to "the strain of madness" in the family, "the normal life of married bliss cannot be for you," Lord John, the future fifth duke, came up with a unique and eventually problematic solution: he lived a double-or perhaps even triple-life. Calling himself Thomas Druce, he wooed and married a 16-year-old village girl and fathered three children. Then he abandoned her, eventually bringing the children to London, where he had fathered the first of three children with another woman whom he refused to marry until his first wife was dead. Confused yet? There's more: Druce also joined the army, ran a successful London department store and might have checked himself into an insane asylum for a time under the name of Dr. Harmer. As the duke of Portland at mid-century, he had underground tunnels built both at his country house and, rumor had it, his London mansion, the better to keep his many secrets. How he managed to juggle his multiple identities is a mystery that British authors Freeman-Keel (From Auschwitz to Alderney) and Crofts (coauthor of Sold) never do solve, but they recreate a fantastic tale of deception, intrigue and madness. Still, though this is an entertaining read, those expecting a strict historical reconstruction of events will be less than satisfied; the authors provide little in the way of sourcing for this "dramatization of a true story in which the truth is tantalizingly elusive." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.The authors play historical detectives in order to unravel a suitably twisted tale of debauchery and treachery in Victorian England. At the heart of the tale is the Cavendish-Bentinck clan, one of the wealthiest and most influential aristocratic families in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. After the seemingly suspicious death of his older brother in 1854, Lord John became the marquess of Titchfield, the fifth duke of Portland, and immediately began constructing elaborate underground passages and chambers beneath the family estate. Even stranger were the veiled rumors that he led a mysterious double life in London. Eventually the rumors were brought to light in one of the most bizarre and sensational court cases in British history. Murder, lunacy, and paternity were but a few of the lurid issues raised, as accusations were bandied back and forth during a trial that rocked the peerage to its hypocritical core. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Tour.</p><p>Before World War II, Shanghai was China's leading commercial center and the most vital and glamorous of Asia's great cities. Against the background of civil war, Shanghai was administered by a consortium of international powers intent on exploiting a defenseless China. The city's seizure by the Imperial Japanese Army in December 1941 ended much of its glitter but not its role as a den of espionage, corruption, and vice. Bernard Wasserstein deftly sets the complex scene as the different powerbrokers, from ambassadors to gangsters, accommodated to the occupying Japanese. The cast of characters is bizarre, ranging from master spies such as Richard Sorge, whose coup was to warn Stalin of Germany's impending invasion, to imposters and petty secret agents living on their wits. People were not what they seemed: the author reveals the often sordid realities behind his protagonists' masks as they struggled for survival and each others' secrets. Richly researched from original sources, <i>Secret War in Shanghai</i> is particularly successful in painting vivid pictures of the different national groups that found themselves caught up in the city's vortex: destitute White Russians, refugees from Hitler's Germany, British <i>taipans</i> trying to hang onto their business interests. The story moves as fast as a racy novel, yet it is all meticulously documented fact. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Shanghai during World War II was a killing field of brutal competition, ideological struggle, and murderous political intrigue. China's largest and most cosmopolitan city, the intelligence capital of the Far East, was a magnet for a corrupt and bizarrely colorful group of men and women drawn to the "Paris of the East" for its seductive promise of high living and easy money. Political and sexual loyalties were for sale to the highest bidder. Allied and Axis agents, criminal gangs, and paramilitary units under various flags waged secret, savage warfare. Espionage, lurid vice, subversion, and crime come together in a lethal concoction. Nowhere on earth was the twilight zone between politics and criminality better exemplified than in this glittering and dangerous place. <p>Secret War in Shanghai is the first book-length account of the little-known story of Shanghai's underground war. The widely respected historian Bernard Wasserstein has researched it entirely from original sources and uncovered startling new evidence of collaboration and treason by American, British, and Australian citizens. This remarkable depiction of complicity and betrayal is history at its most exciting and surprising.</p></p><h2>Every Last Secret: A Mystery (Skeet Bannion Series)</h2><p><p>Half-Cherokee Marquitta "Skeet" Bannion thought she was leaving her troubles behind when she fled the stress of being the highest-ranking woman in the Kansas City Police Department, a jealous cop ex-husband, and a disgraced alcoholic ex-cop father.

But I know nothing that happened can be changed, no dead brought back to life. I had no way of recognizing the tangled webs all around me at the very time I thought I had found sanctuary.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>A middle-of-the-night call used to mean a dead body. All that changed when I moved twelve miles out of Kansas City to this little college town. Not only did I trade the war zone of inner-city policing for a peaceful college campus, but I owned a house, a dog, and plants that were actually alive. Now, my collie, Lady, was barking at the ringing phone, unaccustomed to disturbances at two in the morning.<br>I jerked awake in practiced reflex. My first thought was of murder, but my new reality came back to me. Couldn&#x2019;t be Homicide. Was it my ex-husband to tell me my dad had wrecked his car while driving drunk?<br>I grabbed the phone from the bedside table. &#x201c;Bannion here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chief! It&#x2019;s Dave Parker. I found a body!&#x201d;<br>On automatic pilot, I swung out of bed, wondering how the hell that brand-new hire for the campus police had managed to find a corpse on Chouteau University&#x2019;s pristine campus. Wilma Mankiller, the survivor cat I&#x2019;d brought from the city, jumped from her side of the bed and hid. She knew the phone ringing in the middle of the night meant I&#x2019;d be storming around with no patience for pets.<br>&#x201c;Where? Report, Dave.&#x201d; I pulled underwear and a sweater from drawers.<br>&#x201c;Sorry. I just never...&#x201d;<br>I seized one of my old black Homicide pantsuits from the closet and started to dress. &#x201c;Slow down and breathe, Dave.&#x201d; I heard him take several uneven breaths. &#x201c;Now, report.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Chief. I was making rounds, going past the <i>News</i> offices like you wanted.&#x201d;<br>I had asked the whole department to keep a special eye on the <i>Chouteau University News</i> editor in chief, Andrew McAfee, after breaking up a fight between him and his news editor and hearing from the faculty adviser about sexual assault and theft claims against him. My second-in-command belittled me in front of night and morning shifts for using woman&#x2019;s intuition. Frank Booth thought I stole the chief&#x2019;s job from him&#x2014;though they&#x2019;d never have hired him since he lacked investigative experience. I retaliated by claiming I was using detective&#x2019;s instinct. Then, I insisted everyone keep watch for trouble from McAfee.<br>&#x201c;A light was on in the inner office so I opened the door,&#x201d; Dave continued. &#x201c;To make sure it wasn&#x2019;t someone it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be. It was McAfee. I thought he&#x2019;d just fallen asleep till I got close enough to see the blood. God!&#x201d;<br>Blood. Damn! I fastened my belt and put on my shoulder harness. &#x201c;Manner of death, Dave?&#x201d; Pulling open the drawer in my night table, I checked my gun before holstering it.<br>He took a long, deep, steadying breath. &#x201c;Back of his head&#x2019;s smashed in.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you touch anything?&#x201d; My voice jerked as I ran down the stairs to the front door.<br>&#x201c;Just the door. When I went in. Once I saw him, I backed out quick into the hall and&nbsp;... I guess I panicked. I haven&#x2019;t called it in to Dispatch yet or anything. I called you because it was like you knew. Having us keep an extra eye on him and all.&#x201d;<br>That extra cop-sense at the back of my skull had niggled at me ever since my run-in with Andrew McAfee. I&#x2019;d lived down the street from him, his wife, and his stepson, who walked my dog and mowed my lawn, but I&#x2019;d never really met Andrew until breaking up that fight and learning he was probably stealing money from his student reporters.<br>&#x201c;Your first time finding a body is hard, Dave. You&#x2019;ve done fine. Kept the scene intact.&#x201d; I reached my car and unlocked it. &#x201c;Call Dispatch and have them contact Gil and the coroner and the county evidence techs. Tell Dispatch not to send anyone else over there. I&#x2019;m on my way to you. I don&#x2019;t want anyone messing up the scene. Keep everyone out till I get there or Gil does.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, Chief.&#x201d; His voice sounded less strained.<br>&#x201c;And, Dave,&#x201d; I added, as I started the car and peeled away from my peaceful house into the night, &#x201c;you did fine.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>My name&#x2019;s Marquitta Bannion, but everyone calls me Skeet. Don&#x2019;t ask. My mom is Cherokee and nutty. They&#x2019;re not necessarily connected, but I&#x2019;m not responsible for what she decided to name me. I left the Kansas City Police Department six months ago after becoming their highest-ranking female officer, and I&#x2019;m now chief of the campus police force of Chouteau University in nearby Brewster, Missouri. Some, like my ex-husband, might see it as a comedown. My best friend and surrogate mother, Karen Wise, tells me not to worry about what they think, but she&#x2019;s the one who talked me into coming here in the first place. I wanted to get away from the city and the job that ate my life&#x2014;and, most of all, my dad and the Internal Affairs investigation that led to his retirement. Between Big Charlie and me, the name Bannion used to mean a lot in the KCPD. I didn&#x2019;t like seeing that change, so I left&#x2014;force, father, and ex-husband. It was an easy decision.<br>My Cherokee grandmother always said, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re waiting for things to be perfect in life, young lady, you&#x2019;ll be waiting a long time.&#x201d; Though I&#x2019;ve always ignored what my mother told me and finally learned to ignore Big Charlie, I listen to Gran. I&#x2019;ve learned not to wait.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I made that short drive back to campus in record time and parked illegally in front of Moller Hall. Using my master key to let myself in, I paced through the dark, echoing building, carrying my crime scene kit from the trunk of my car.<br>The shadows moved with me as I headed to the offices of the university&#x2019;s student-run newspaper. At the end of the hallway, Dave Parker stood nervous watch in the gloom surrounding the pool of light that poured through the office door. With his young face, he could have been one of our students, if not for the uniform.<br>&#x201c;How are you doing?&#x201d; I asked.<br>Beads of sweat stood out on his ashen face despite the chill of the hallway. Dave had recently graduated from the regional police academy and joined our department just two days earlier. Night patrol had seemed a safe, innocuous place for him to start.<br>&#x201c;Are you going to be okay here? Or should I ask Bill to trade with you? He&#x2019;s seen dead bodies before.&#x201d;<br>Dave shook his head resolutely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay. You don&#x2019;t have to drag the sergeant out. It was just a shock at first.&#x201d;<br>I nodded and smiled to reassure him. &#x201c;What have you done, and what have you touched?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I left the lights on,&#x201d; he said. His hand twitched in the direction of the light twice before he got it under control. &#x201c;I turned on these in the newsroom as I went through to the office where I saw lights already on. When I came out, I left them on.&#x201d; He grimaced. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think to turn them off at first. I just wanted to get out and call you. Then I figured it&#x2019;s best if I don&#x2019;t add any more fingerprints.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine. No sign of anyone?&#x201d; I set my kit on the floor and opened it.<br>He shook his head vigorously. &#x201c;I checked pretty good.&#x201d;<br>He probably had, dismayed at standing watch alone in a place that might be hiding a murderer. I squatted on the cold tile floor and dug through my bag to pull out surgical gloves. &#x201c;So you just touched that light switch and the door to the office?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And the body. I checked for a pulse. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re supposed to do, right?&#x201d; He looked at me, frowning and biting his lip.<br>&#x201c;You handled this like an old pro.&#x201d; I stood and slipped on the gloves.<br>His face relaxed and regained some color. &#x201c;I sure didn&#x2019;t want to mess up something this major.&#x201d;<br>I smiled at him. He was going to be worth bringing along. &#x201c;Was the exterior door to Moller locked when you entered?&#x201d;<br>Dave nodded. &#x201c;Had to use my master to open it.&#x201d;<br>I frowned. Either the killer had an office in Moller or access to a Moller key or master.<br>Closing my kit, I picked it up. &#x201c;Is Gil on his way? And the coroner?&#x201d;<br>Dave nodded. &#x201c;Dispatch said she&#x2019;d send them out and notify the sheriff&#x2019;s office for techs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You keep watch here. Only those people get in. Call Bill to cover the front in case the media show up. He can keep them out.&#x201d;<br>As Dave nodded and pulled out his radio, I headed into the newsroom of The <i>Chouteau University News,</i> eyes scanning the room. To my left, a bulletin board fluttered with flyers, a large poster from the movie <i>Front Page</i> beside it. On the next wall, another bulletin board held the last issue of the <i>News,</i> comments in ink scribbled all over the pages. The work of the faculty adviser, I assumed. Six desks crowded the room. The staff would tell us if anything was out of place.<br>I took a deep breath before moving through the door opposite the hall. No matter how many I&#x2019;ve seen&#x2014;a lot&#x2014;I never get completely used to corpses. I&#x2019;d never have made an undertaker.<br>Facing me in the shallower room inside was a beat-up wooden desk. The body sat behind it, bloodied head resting on the desk surface. Moving into the room and to the side, I smelled the coppery blood scent and the odor of feces and urine, an inevitability of death. Another reason for the deep breath before entering. Death stinks.<br>I could see the face of the dead man, Andrew McAfee. Since the blows damag...</p><h2>Botanica's Trees &amp; Shrubs: Over 1000 Pages &amp; over 2000 Plants Listed</h2><p>The ultimate guide to trees and shrubs.

His paintings, many of which show a single intense moment, compel the viewer to participate in a world of middle-class suburban ambiguity and drama. In Fischl's engaging distinctly American canvases, narrative, morality, sexuality, and psychology are preeminent. <br><br>This volume, an expanded edition of <i>Eric Fischl 1970-2000</i>, is the most comprehensive examination of this important contemporary painter. More than 250 works, selected in conjunction with the artist, present the full scope of Fischl's career: the formative work of the 1970s; the breakthrough paintings of the 1980s, including the controversial <i>Sleepwalker</i> and <i>Bad Boy</i>; and the mature work, often of a personal and contemplative nature, of the 1990s and 2000s. In his most recent paintings, Fischl has turned to multipiece cycles: <i>The Bed, The Chair</i> series, starting with <i>The Philosopher's Chair</i>; canvases inspired by trips to Italy and India; and the paintings&#x2014;Fischl terms them "narrative fictions"&#x2014;of the "Krefeld Project." These engrossing images have been accomplished with a mastery that has been compared to that of Caravaggio. <br><br>The introduction, by philosopher and critic Arthur C. Danto, offers a perceptive study of Fischl's work over the course of four decades. Commentary drawn from interviews with the artist, conducted by noted writer Robert Enright, accompanies the paintings. Finally, a witty and personal afterword by Steve Martin, best known as a gifted comic actor and author, but also an astute collector of modern art, discusses <i>Barbeque</i>, a famed Fischl painting from his private collection.</p><p><b>Arthur C.

The works present a wide variety of styles and themes and invite close examination.<br><br>Mughal culture was one of the richest the world has ever seen. The magnificence of the Mughal palaces and tombs, the pomp of the court, the lavish ceremonies and feasts, the fame of the court poets, intellectuals, painters and musicians, the sumptuousness of the courtiers' attire--all these came together to create an aristocratic culture of extraordinary wealth and grandeur. Books--and above all books lavishly decorated with exquisite miniatures--had a role and a status in Mughal culture which is almost unimaginable today. They were among the most valuable and certainly the most prized objects in the imperial treasury and were used systematically and effectively to propagate the political goals of the ruler.<br><br>Whereas Mughal artists depict the real world, record historical events, and portray their patrons in realistic likenesses, Deccanni painters, instead, aim at evoking lyrical moods. They invent paradisal dreamworlds bathed in fantastic, flamboyant colors, sparkling with gold. When they represent their rulers, they create idealized, introspective figures lost in the quiet enchantment of love, or music, or merely the perfume of a beautiful flower.</p><p></p><h2>Violence and Culture in the Antebellum South</h2><p>This provocative book draws from a variety of sources&#x2014;literature, politics, folklore, social history&#x2014;to attempt to set Southern beliefs about violence in a cultural context. According to Dickson D. Bruce, the control of violence was a central concern of antebellum Southerners. Using contemporary sources, Bruce describes Southerners&#x2019; attitudes as illustrated in their duels, hunting, and the rhetoric of their politicians. He views antebellum Southerners as pessimistic and deeply distrustful of social relationships and demonstrates how this world view impelled their reliance on formal controls to regularize human interaction. The attitudes toward violence of masters, slaves, and &#x201c;plain-folk&#x201d;&#x2014;the three major social groups of the period&#x2014;are differentiated, and letters and family papers are used to illustrate how Southern child-rearing practices contributed to attitudes toward violence in the region. The final chapter treats Edgar Allan Poe as a writer who epitomized the attitudes of many Southerners before the Civil War.</p><p>Dickson D.

Sadly, narrator Jeannie Hackett's manner and pace take this material to the edge of smugness. She risks making the author sound like a know-it-all. Still, Hackett moderates her vocal formality with delicacy, and by the end of this fascinating program many listeners will be convinced of the author's legitimacy.

They then engaged Napoleon&#39;s troops in combat at the battle of Hanua in an unsuccessful attempt to cut off their retreat to France. This book by Otto von Pivka provides an in depth examination of the organisation, equipment, weaponry and uniforms of Napoleon&#39;s Bavarian allies. The fascinating text is accompanied by numerous illustrations and eight full page colour plates.</p><p>Otto von Pivka (the nom de plume of Digby Smith) wrote his first title for Osprey Publishing in 1972 (The Black Brunswickers, in the Men-at-Arms series). He is a prolific author, who has contributed many titles to the Men-at-Arms series on the armies and forces of the Napoleonic Wars. A former major in the British Army, he is now retired, but continues to write books on this key period. Richard Hook was born in 1938 and trained at Reigate College of Art. After national service with 1st Bn, Queen&#39;s Royal Regiment he became art editor of the much-praised magazine Finding Out during the 1960s. He has worked as a freelance illustrator ever since, earning an international reputation particularly for his deep knowledge of Native American material culture; and has illustrated more than 30 Osprey titles. Richard is married and lives in Sussex; his three children Adam, Jason, and Christa are all professionally active in various artistic disciplines.An unrivalled source of information on the uniforms, insignia and appearance of the world&#39;s fighting men of past and present. The Men-At-Arms titles cover subjects as diverse as the Imperial Roman army, the Napoleonic wars and German airborne troops in a popular 48-page format including some 40 photographs and diagrams, and eight full-color plates.</p><h2>Light of Glory: Children&#39;s Stories on the Early Days of the Unification Church</h2><p><p>Light of Glory is a collection of fictional stories that follow the lives of True Parents, the Rev. Dr. Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, the founders of the Unification Church.

The four parts are:&nbsp;</p><p>Part 1: The Early Years</p><p>Part 2: Sun Myung Moon Begins His Ministry</p><p>Part 3: The Early Days of the Unification Movement</p><p>Part 4: Our True Parents</p><p>True Father was called &#x201c;Sun Myung Moon&#x201d; or just &#x201c;Mr. Moon&#x201d; in his early years into adult hood and then later called &#x201c;Teacher Moon&#x201d; when he began his ministry in the 1950&#x2019;s in North Korea. Unificationists have since called him &#x201c;True Father&#x201d; and his wife, &#x201c;True Mother&#x201d;. Eventually, together they came to be known as True Parents.

Though considered a financial failure, the 1964-65 World' s Fair was a Sixties flashpoint in areas&nbsp;from politics to pop culture, technology to urban planning, and civil rights to violent crime.</p><p>In an epic narrative, the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Tomorrow-Land </i>shows the astonishing pivots taken by New York City, America, <i>and </i>the world during the Fair. It fetched Disney's empire from California and Michelangelo's <i>La Pieta</i> from Europe; and displayed flickers of innovation from Ford, GM, and NASA&#x2014;from undersea and outerspace colonies to personal computers. It housed the controversial&nbsp;work of&nbsp;Warhol (until Governor Rockefeller had it removed); and lured Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;Fair&#x2014;and its house band, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians&#x2014;sat in the musical shadows of the Beatles and Bob Dylan, who changed rock-and-roll <i>right there in Queens</i>. And as Southern civil rights efforts turned deadly, and violent protests also occurred in and around the Fair, Harlem-based Malcolm X predicted a frightening future of inner-city racial conflict.</p><p>World's Fairs have always been collisions of eras, cultures, nations, technologies, ideas, and art. But the trippy, turbulent, Technicolor, Disney, corporate, and often misguided 1964-65 Fair was truly exceptional.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Tirella</b> wrote about Queens for <i>The New York Times&#x2019;</i>s much missed City Section, and penned pieces for the paper&#x2019;s Metro and Business Sections. &nbsp;A former Senior Editor at Fortune Small Business, his work has also appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, <i>the Daily News</i>, Portfolio.com, and MSN.com.</p>A <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller!<br><br>&#x201c;Tirella explores the contrast between the purported idealism of the 1964 World&#x2019;s Fair and the conflict and compromise that surrounded the event....

He hung out at the library until it closed, and then, wishing he had money for a hamburger, he wandered down to his spot on Magnolia Creek. It was a pretty good hike, a couple of miles out of town past the Griffin sisters' peach orchard and through a hundred yards of tangled weeds, but at eleven, he was up for it. He could have run that far and not been out of breath.<br><br>When the night surrounded him and clouds gathered in the inky sky, he once more contemplated going home. He was hungry, but food wasn't always worth the trouble. He wasn't afraid of the dark or of being alone deep in the country. Home was a whole lot scarier.<br><br>Stretched out on the cool earth with his hands stacked behind his head, he listened to the peaceful night sounds, the sawing rhythm of katydids that sometimes grew so loud he felt as if they were inside him, and the splash of bullfrogs diving from the nearby bank.<br><br>A rumble of thunder sounded in the distance. It was probably somewhere far off, clean over in the mountains. He wouldn't worry about that. He didn't mind a little rain. If he had to, he could hightail it past the inn to the abandoned gristmill, even though the place was kind of spooky.<br><br>The mill was probably haunted. That's what his buddy Spence said. The last time they'd gone there to explore, Spence had heard something and freaked out, so Brody would rather not go to the mill unless he had to.<br><br>Would the old man be passed out by now? Or would he be waiting with clenched fist and a hankering to take out his hatred of life on the good-for-nothing son of the good-forless woman who'd left them both so long ago the boy had forgotten her? Mostly. Somehow it was Brody's fault that his mother had left, and the old man never let him forget it, though he never gave a reason. Brody was pretty much clueless about his absentee mother. His angry father he understood, but thoughts of his mother left him lonely and nursing guilt he didn't understand. He must have done something really bad to make her up and leave that way.<br><br>A mosquito buzzed somewhere in the humid darkness. He listened close while the pest came in for a landing, waited until the sound stopped and then he swatted. A few bug bites was better than the alternative.<br><br>He didn't like killing anything, even bugs, but as the old man would say, "It's a dog-eat-dog world. Eat the dog before he eats you."<br><br>Something about that didn't sound right to Brody, but what did he know? That's what the old man always said. A punk kid like Brody didn't know nothing.<br><br>He sighed at the moon and closed his eyes.<br><br>Better catch some z's and wait awhile longer. The old man was a bull, and once enraged, he had blood in his eyes. Clint Thomson was seldom anything but enraged on payday, especially when it came to his good-for-nothing son.<br><br>* * *<br><br>It was a dark and stormy night, a clich� Hayden Winters dearly loved. These broody, moody nights of lightning and thunder and violent wind fueled his imagination like no other. A man intent on committing murder...<br><br>The storm had moved in around midnight, interrupting his original plans to sleep. He could never sleep on a night like this. Didn't want to, especially here in a house filled with memories and secrets.<br><br>Everyone, he believed, had a secret, and the South was filled with them. That's why he'd come.<br><br>Hayden had a secret, too, a psychological cankerworm. One that was eating a raw, black hole in his soul. Not that he'd ever let anyone see inside to know that much about him. To the world, Hayden Winters was a winner, a success, a man who brushed problems away with a charming smile. He was a man invited to the best parties he seldom attended and who gave rare but coveted interviews. A man with a charmed life. But on these dark, moody, broody nights the demons danced around the edges of his fertile mind. He wondered at his sanity, and he knew it was only by a merciful God that he was strong of constitution and could keep the demons in their rightful place. Most of the time.<br><br>So he killed people. Dozens of them. Books littered with bodies fed some perverse need in the populace and kept his bank account fat and happy.<br><br>In the elegant rented bedroom&#x2014;the Mulberry Room&#x2014;lit only by the glow of his laptop, Hayden rose, went to the windows to watch and listen as rain lashed the sides of Peach Orchard Inn with its silver-on-black fingers clawing to get in.<br><br>The view outside was far different from what it had been upon his arrival earlier today. An Australian shepherd, graying around the edges, had drowsed on the long and glorious antebellum veranda. Hayden had immediately envisioned himself on the wicker furniture, feet up on the railing with a glass of Julia Presley's almost-famous peach tea and his imagination in flight.<br><br>The two-story columned mansion had shone in the sun, glowing in its whiteness with dark-trimmed shutters, flowers spilling everywhere and thick vines twining like great green arms around the oak trees. He'd driven down the winding lane of massive magnolias right into an antebellum past, far from the distractions and manic pace of the modern world.<br><br>Peach Orchard Inn, a simple name for a magnificent house, restored, he would bet, to better than its former glory. His assistant, who knew him better than most, though not well, had discovered the inn while on vacation and suggested he write the next bestseller here. Exhausted by the city bustle and another romance gone sour, he'd jumped at the idea. His ex should have taken him at his word. He'd told her from the beginning that he was neither husband nor father material. The reasons for this aversion he'd kept to himself, more for her protection than his. She didn't know that, though, and had been hurt.<br><br>He hated hurting people. Other than in his books. And the latest episode had driven him deeper into himself. A man like him ought not to need other people.<br><br>He could work here, rest here, research small-town secrets for the next thriller. There were plenty of interesting places to commit murder.<br><br>Across the road, a single light glowed like a beacon in the storm. The source was the abandoned, dilapidated gristmill that had once been part of this farm. He knew this because he was ferociously curious and knowing was his business. Abandoned buildings provided perfect places to get away with murder. He'd be suitably inspired here among the hills and hollows of southern Tennessee.<br><br>A blue-fire javelin of lightning, fierce as a bolt straight from the hand of Zeus, slit the night like a fiery blade. Gorgeous stuff.<br><br>Hayden stretched, rolled his neck, considered a walk in the violence.<br><br>He'd be up most of the night during a wild thunderstorm of this magnitude. He could feel the yet-unformed story brewing in his blood, a bubbling cauldron of energy and creativity.<br><br>Coffee, and plenty of it, was a must. He wasn't a Red Bull kind of guy. Something about it seemed addictive to him, and if there was anything he feared greater than losing his only useful resource&#x2014;his fertile mind&#x2014;it was addiction. Addictions came, he knew, in many forms.<br><br>Leaving the laptop curser to blink a blind eye, he let himself out of the luxurious Mulberry Room and made his way down shadowy stairs carpeted in bloodred, his hand on the smooth wooden banister, taking care on the creaky third step he'd noticed earlier. No self-respecting author of murder and mayhem missed a creaky step.<br><br>Lightning illuminated the curved staircase, and thunder rumbled like a thousand kettle drums. The house stood steady, quiet even, as if it had weathered too much to be bothered by a thunderstorm. There were stories here. He could feel them.<br><br>Hayden's Scots-Irish blood heard the dance of his ancestors in the thunder, saw wave-tossed fishing vessels on storm-gray seas and imagined a woman standing on the shore, hand to her forehead, watching while in the misty shadows lurked the equally watchful predator, biding his time.<br><br>Hayden tucked away the image for future reference. The new book was to explore the dark undercurrents hidden behind the welcoming smiles and sweet tea of a small town in the rural South, not the storm-tossed coasts of Ireland.<br><br>At the base of the stairs, he crossed the foyer through to an area the proprietress had termed the front parlor, a room of times past with a marble fireplace enclosure and Victorian decor, and into the much more modern kitchen. He fumbled for a light switch, mildly concerned about waking the sister-owners who resided somewhere on the first floor, but dismissed the concern in favor of coffee.<br><br>A quick survey of the brown granite countertops revealed no coffeemaker. He cursed himself for not remembering to ask about essential coffee equipment in his rented room, of which there was none. Here, in the large copper-and-cream kitchen, the coffee machine could be anywhere. He had no luck locating it but found a tea bag caddie, a discovery that made him snarl.<br><br>While he pondered the usefulness of lemon zinger tea, his cell phone buzzed against his hip. He winced at the sudden racket, though if the thunder didn't wake the house, a ringtone shouldn't. Still, out of consideration and being the new guest in the place, he slapped the phone silent. He'd intended to dump the device in the bottom of his suitcase and forget it for a few days, but out of habit, he'd stuck the phone in his back pocket.<br><br>"A pity," he grumbled. "And stupid."<br><br>He knew who the caller was. The only person who ever called him in the dead of night. She'd been the one who taught him never to sleep too soundly.<br><br>"Hello, Dora Lee."<br><br>He heard her quivery intake of breath and braced himself for the histrionics or cursing. One or the other was inevitable.<br><br>When she didn't respond, a tingle of worry forced a regrettable question. "Are you all right?"<br><br>"No, I'm not all right, though a lot you care. I'm sick. You know I'm sick, and you don't help me. How am I supposed to get my medicine?"<br><br>Hayden closed his eyes and leaned against the hard counter edge. He could imagine her there in the cluttered trailer among unwashed dishes and fast-food containers filled with dry, half-eaten meals, hair wild and eyes wilder, hands shaking in desperation. "What did you do with the last money?"<br><br>"You think that's enough? You think I can pay rent and buy food and keep the lights on with that?"<br><br>His sigh was heavy. "Is the electricity off again?"<br><br>"Been off. I had to have my medicine. What good is lights if a body hurts too bad to open her eyes."<br><br>"Dora Lee, I won't send money for any more pills." God knew, he'd contributed to her addiction too long already with the ever-raw hope that she'd change, a hope that even now burned with a flickering flame. "You're killing yourself. I'll come to Kentucky, get you into a clinic&#x2014;"<br><br>The scream in his ear was louder than the thunder. "Shut up! Shut up&#x2014;you hear me? You ungrateful scum. I should have drowned you when I had the chance, for all the good you've done me. Keep your filthy money." The line went dead in his ear.<br><br>Weariness of the past few months pressed in. His stir of creative energy seeped out like lifeblood on the kitchen tile.<br><br>He should never have given her his cell phone number, but the desperate little boy inside him still yearned to make things better with his embittered, addicted nightmare of a mother. Even when he was small, before the dark and deadly underbelly of a coal mine had killed his gentle father, Dora Lee had popped illegally gotten pills for imaginary headaches and hated her only child. And he didn't know why.<br><br>His mother had no idea the same hated son was now Hayden Winters, successful novelist. It was a secret he would never share with her. Could never share. The ramifications were too deep and disturbing to consider.<br><br>Long ago, he'd changed his name and re-created his past in an effort to become something besides the dirtiest little boy in the worst part of Appalachia. Suave, confident Hayden Winters was as fictitious as the novels he wrote. Dora Lee wouldn't have cared anyway. All she cared about was that he sent money.<br><br>For her unconcerned ignorance, Hayden would ever be grateful to the God who'd rescued him from the mines and Dora Lee Briggs. If the press got hold of his mother, Hayden could kiss his tightly controlled privacy goodbye.<br><br>He was glad she couldn't read, though as a needy boy, hoping to please his mother, he'd offered to teach her. For his offer, she'd battered him with the book until the binding loosened and the pages ripped, raging that she wasn't as stupid as he thought.<br><br>At least a couple of times a year, he made the trek to see her, again out of some psychological wound that needed to be fed. Each time, he'd leave behind another piece of himself along with a parting gift that she would trade, in addition to her monthly draw, for OxyContin or whatever pills she could get that would take her away from reality for a while.<br><br>Dora Lee Briggs was his ugly secret. One of them.<br><br>With the wound in his soul open and throbbing, Hayden stuck a cup of water in the microwave. Lemon zinger would have to do.</p><h2>The Best Book of Mummies</h2><p>A colorful collection of cadavers and caskets ranging in origin from the City of the Dead to the Valley of the Kings, brings to life the mysteries of the mummies and the ancient Egyptians.</p><p><p><b>Miranda Smith</b> is a long-standing editor of information books for both children and adults and is the author of Kingfisher Knowledge: Sharks.</p><p>&#x201c;A comprehensive basic reference providing an introduction to the mummies of ancient Egypt. &#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Children's Literature</i></p><p>&#x201c;The book's layout is airy and appealing...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>Kansa Indians: A History of the Wind People, 1673-1873 (The Civilization of American Indian Series)</h2><p><p>After their first contacts with whites in the seventeenth century, the Kansa Indians began migrating from the eastern United States to what is now eastern Kansas, by way of the Missouri Valley.

He relaxes in a flannel shirt printed with pictures of cheeses from around the world, he has a caged pet ladybug named Terfle, he writes endearing thank-you letters to the universe each night, and he has a big heart--a heart that aches for the fearless aviatrix Ms. Linka Perflinger, who unexpectedly visits his shop requesting an emergency rush repair of her wristwatch. Little does he know that this brief rendezvous with the jaunty adventuress will change his life forever. When a week goes by without word from her, he doesn't know whether to be worried or angry. He drafts a slightly unpleasant, then desperate, then not-too-sweet, not-too-sour letter to her and awaits her response. Nothing. Even nasty encounters with his neighbor (the horribly garish and affected cosmetics tycoon Tucka Mertslin) and pleasant interludes with his artist friend Mirrin don't distract him from his new heart-quickening obsession.<p> His worst fears start to cement when a yellow-eyed, thin-lipped, sharp-tongued rat comes to his shop and says with a dreadful smile, "I've come for Linka Perflinger's watch." Hermux isn't about to fork over his beloved's watch without a claim check, and ends up following the rat... all the way to Linka's house! And, what's this? Is she being kidnapped? The plot thickens as Hermux boldly enters her apartment (what has gotten into him?) and discovers a mysterious letter from Teulabonari and an overturned spicy-smelling plant. As he says to his ladybug that night, "This is the beginning of a new career for me. Either as a detective or a jailbird. Only time will tell. If it turns out to be the latter I will be asking you for hints on decorating my cage." Soon he begins to make a connection with these strange clues and the cosmetics mogul Tucka, who pulls him into her scheme to create eternal youth in a bottle (to be taken internally).</p><p> Suffice it to say that gentle Hermux gets in way over his head with his detective work and proceeds to have fur-raising encounters involving spies, thieves, killers, betrayal, the Fountain of Youth, snakes, calliopes, and dramatic rescue attempts. Throughout it all, however, Hermux continues to thank the world at large: "Thank you for corner grocers. For sandwiches and honey fizz. For scary news and narrow escapes and trolleys and shopping bags. Thank you for loyal pets and bold adventurers (and adventuresses)." Readers will be disarmed by Hermux's earnest, inquisitive nature and zeal for life--and thoroughly engaged by the suspenseful action adventure. Highly recommended!

The name meant untold riches and promise to Jutka, a young Hungarian girl who was captivated by stories of a vast, majestic country where people were able to breathe free of hatred and prejudice. Freedom was in short supply, but hatred was everywhere in Hungary as hundreds of thousands of Jews were deported to concentration camps during the last year of WWII. Jutka, her friends, and her family are sent to Auschwitz.<br><br>In that hellish place, there was another Kanada. It was the ironic name given to the storehouse at Auschwitz where the possessions &#x2014; clothing and jewelry &#x2014; stripped from the victims were deposited, and where Jutka was put to work. <br><br>The war may have ended, but it did not end the suffering of many of the inmates of concentration camps. Many had no homes to go to, and if they did, they were not welcome. Hundreds <br>went back to Poland and were murdered. Famished, diseased, and homeless, they lived in the hopelessness of camps, wondering if they could ever find a home in the world. Some went to Israel, but for Jutka there was only one dream left her &#x2014; the dream of a country full of hope, where she would no longer have to live in fear.<br><br>Eva Wiseman&#x2019;s powerful novel describes the war and its long, difficult aftermath with compassion and tenderness.</p><p>Born in Hungary, <b>Eva Wiseman</b> came to Canada with her family when she was a girl. She began writing at a young age and showed an early passion for journalism. Her first young adult novel, <i>A Place Not Home</i>, was a finalist for numerous literary awards across North America. Her second novel, <i>My Canary Yellow Star</i>, was also shortlisted for several awards and won the McNally Robinson Books for Young People Award. Her third novel, <i>No One Must Know</i>, was equally critically acclaimed. <b>Eva Wiseman</b> is the mother of two children. She lives in Winnipeg with her husband.During World War II, life for Jutka, a 14-year-old Hungarian Jew, turns upside down within a matter of months. Jutka and her family are transported to Auschwitz, where her mother and grandmother perish, and she endures unimaginable cruelty, which Wiseman described in significant, sometimes graphic detail. Dreams of Canada, inspired by a book from a Canadian relative, sustain her. After the liberation, Jutka falls in love with Sandor, who dreams of relocating to Israel. Jutka must choose a future with the man she loves or her own dream of Canada and life with her only remaining kin. The book is notable among Holocaust fiction as it depicts life after the war, when concentration camp survivors, ostracized and homeless, picked up the pieces of their lives. However, the story sometimes meanders as it strives to depict the times, and some elements and terms (for example, <i>Eretz Israel</i>) want more explanation. Still, Jutka is a resilient, realistically drawn heroine, and readers will easily bond to and pull for her as she navigates her loss of innocence. <i>Heather Booth</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Do you bend sympathetically when you see someone Ahenny(2)? Can you deal with a Naugatuck(3) without causing a Toronto(4)? Will you suffer from Kettering(5) this summer? <br>Probably. You are almost certainly familiar with all these experiences but just didn't know that there are words for them. Well, in fact, there aren't--or rather there weren't, until Douglas Adams and John Lloyd decided to plug these egregious linguistic lacunae(6). They quickly realized that just as there are an awful lot of experiences that no one has a name for, so there are an awful lot of names for places you will never need to go to. What a waste. As responsible citizens of a small and crowded world, we must all learn the virtues of recycling(7) and put old, worn-out but still serviceable names to exciting, vibrant, new uses. This is the book that does that for you: "The Deeper Meaning of Liff--a whole new solution to the problem of Great Wakering(8) <p>1--The feeling of aluminum foil against your fillings. <br>2--The way people stand when examining other people's bookshelves. <br>3--A plastic packet containing shampoo, mustard, etc., which is impossible to open except by biting off <br>the corners. <br>4--Generic term for anything that comes out in a gush, despite all your efforts to let it out carefully, e.g., flour into a white sauce, ketchup onto fish, a dog into the yard, and another naughty meaning that we can't put on the cover. <br>5--The marks left on your bottom and thighs after you've been sitting sunbathing in a wicker chair. <br>6--God knows what this means <br>7--For instance, some of this book was first published in Britain twenty-six years ago.<br>8--Look it up yourself.</p>Douglas Adams created all the various and contradictory manifestations of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy: radio, novels, TV, computer game, stage adaptations, comic book and bath towel.

Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge, UK and lived with his wife and daughter in Islington, London, before moving to Santa Barbara, California, where he died suddenly in 2001.

By the time of Sagan's death in 1996, the series had been seen by half a billion people; Sagan was perhaps the best-known scientist on the planet. Explaining how the series came about, Sagan recalled:<p> </p><blockquote>I was positive from my own experience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration of the planets and in many kindred scientific topics--the origin of life, the Earth, and the Cosmos, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, our connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest could be excited through that most powerful communications medium, television.</blockquote><p> Sagan's own interest and enthusiasm for the universe were so vivid and infectious, his screen presence so engaging, that viewers and readers couldn't help but be caught up in his vision. From stars in their "billions and billions" to the amino acids in the primordial ocean, Sagan communicated a feeling for science as a process of discovery. Inevitably, some of the science in <i>Cosmos</i> has been outdated in the years since 1980--but Sagan's sense of wonder is ageless. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>This visually stunning book with over 250 full-color illustrations, many of them never before published, is based on Carl Sagan?s thirteen-part television series. Told with Sagan?s remarkable ability to make scientific ideas both comprehensible and exciting, <b>Cosmos</b> is about science in its broadest human context, how science and civilization grew up together.<br><br>The book also explores spacecraft missions of discovery of the nearby planets, the research in the Library of ancient Alexandria, the human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, the origin of life, the death of the Sun, the evolution of galaxies and the origins of matter, suns and worlds.<br><br>Sagan retraces the fifteen billion years of cos-mic evolution that have transformed matter into life and consciousness, enabling the Cosmos to wonder about itself. He considers the latest findings on life elsewhere and how we might communicate with the beings of other worlds.<br><br><b>Cosmos</b> is the story of our long journey of discovery and the forces and individuals who helped to shape modern science, including Democritus, Hypatia, Kepler, Newton, Huy-gens, Champollion, Lowell and Humason. Sagan looks at our planet from an extra-terrestrial vantage point and sees a blue jewel-like world, inhabited by a lifeform that is just beginning to discover its own unity and to ven-ture into the vast ocean of space.</p><h2>Zoom Broom</h2><p>The hilarious sequel to the best-selling Piggie Pie! pits the ever-grouchy Gritch the Witch against a smooth-talking used-broom salesman who tries to outfox her, only to wind up as a furry accessory on her new convertible.</p><p>Gritch the Witch is hungry and her <i>batscotti</i> and <i>eek!spresso</i> snack isn't quite doing the trick. She wants a more filling, furry snack. She wants bunny. On her way to the Farmer in the Dell's rabbit-ridden place, she and her broomstick experience a crash landing, shortly after her old broom stalls in midair: "It spit. Sputtered. Coughed. Chugged. Choked. And then it gave out a long gasping, gurgly gurgle, did one loop-d-loop, and tailspinned toward ground zero." Desperate for a new vehicle, she ends up at Foxy's, a used-vehicle lot marked by signs such as "Foxy's: We'll take you for a ride." Foxy tries to sell her a magic carpet from "A Lad in the East," then he attempts to unload Cinderella's pumpkin coach: "Very low mileage. Used only once. Runs like a charm." The fox's cheesy sales tactics don't go over very well: "Save the spiel, cut the chit-chat, and can the flim-flam, Foxy!" she shouts. Her fury only escalates when she asks, "Which one is the one I want?"--catapulting them into an infuriating "Who's on first"-style repartee over "Witch 1," the name of a certain model of broom. <i>Zoom Broom</i>, Margie Palatini's over-the-top sequel to the immensely popular <i>Piggie Pie</i>, is as smart-alecky and fast-paced as they come, and Howard Fine's colorful, action-packed, almost grotesquely intense illustrations are perfect for this wild and witchy ride. (Ages 4 to 9) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>PreSchool-Grade 3-Temper tantrums and exclamation points abound in this riotous follow-up to Piggie Pie (Clarion, 1998). Sidetracked from her usual "gourmet" pursuits by the untimely demise of her flying broom, Gritch the Witch heads out to buy a new one and takes on a slick fox from the old school of car salesmanship. However, clever Foxy is no match for a negotiator of Gritch's caliber; she gets several snazzy brooms, a flashy convertible, and even a fox-fur coat in the bargain. Sporting cool new sunglasses, Gritch flies, rants, and stomps her way through this latest adventure. The artwork is beyond active; it's slapstick, full of cinematographic views and pans, and filled with visual jokes. The plot doesn't quite have the focus and drive of the first story, but there's plenty of humorous action. The text fairly sings with alliteration, rhyming words, onomatopoeia, puns, allusions, and plenty of bold-text bellowing. It begs to be read aloud, at the top of your lungs. The younger set will love the volatile, uncontrollable Gritch, while the older crowd will enjoy spotting the references to everything from Clement Moore's "The Night Before Christmas" to a full-blown parody of Abbott and Costello's comedy routine, "Who's on First?" Fans of Piggie Pie will eat up this sequel.<br><i>Torrie Hodgson, Burlington Public Library, WA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Guide to Moab, UT Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails 2nd edition</h2><p>Guide to Moab, UT Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails 2nd edition is a NEW book from Charles A.

A graduate of Stanford University and UCLA School of Law, her past jobs included prosecuting first-degree murder cases as a district attorney and working as a case officer with top secret clearance for the CIA.<b></b><p><b> One </b> </p><blockquote> <p> It was snowing as hard as it could possibly snow.<br> -- <br> Larry Heywood, assistant patrol director at Alpine Meadows in 1982 </p></blockquote> <p> It was around 5 a.m., just before daybreak, when Larry Heywood pulled into the Alpine Meadows parking lot on March 31, 1982. The multi-day snowstorm would finally force the ski area to shut down entirely that day, but open or not, as assistant patrol director at the resort, Larry was one of the few employees who still had to report to work. </p><p> The blizzard had hit the Sierra Nevada the previous Saturday evening, and it had been snowing steadily -- and hard -- for the past four days. With two to three feet of new snow falling daily, by that Wednesday morning the storm had dumped nearly seven and a half feet of new snow on top of an existing 89-inch base. </p><p> Most of the roads were impassable because snowplows were unable to keep ahead of the snowfall, and the tourists up for ski vacations were more or less trapped in their rental houses and condos. Larry's big old turquoise Jeep Wagoneer, nicknamed Gus because that's what the random letters in the license plate happened to spell, had made it, barely, from his home on Lake Tahoe's West Shore to Highway 89 and then down the three miles of Alpine Meadows Road that dead-ended at the ski area. Between the road conditions and the fury of the blizzard, Larry had been creeping along at maybe six mph. He spent much of the drive with his door open, craning around it to try to see where the road was and if anyone else was on it. </p><p> On his way to work Larry had picked up Thom Orsi, a member of the ski area's trail crew. Thom, who had spied crocus bulbs beginning to bloom in his yard the previous Saturday, trudged down to the street that morning on top of the snowdrifts in his driveway, with his car, unseen, buried somewhere beneath him. As they headed toward the ski resort, the drive was oppressive, almost claustrophobic. Maneuvering his Jeep in a virtual elevator shaft of snow, Larry asked Thom to keep an eye out for avalanche activity on the slopes above them. "You see anything moving," Larry told Thom, "you scream." Thom spent the remainder of the trip -- in the dark, in a near whiteout -- clearing off his foggy window and gaping up at the snow-drenched mountains. </p><p> Two days earlier, Alpine Meadows had closed the upper part of the ski area, and the previous day, it was running only the three lowest chairlifts for the benefit of a dozen or so skiers. The lifts high up on the mountain, leading to the advanced runs, were swaying too much in the shrieking winds to be operated -- ironically, skiers who were hard-core enough to ski despite the storm had access to just the shortest, easiest slopes. </p><p> On the thirty-first, the intense snowfall -- several new inches continued to fall every hour -- combined with winds gusting up to 120 mph, made it too risky for the resort to operate at all. The acres of existing snow up on the ridges above the ski area remained poised and still, piling higher and building up ton by ton with new snow. As fresh snow fell, the violence of the southwesterly wind whipped it across and down, cross-loading the mountain and transporting more snow to the lower slopes. On top of that, the freakishness of the fluctuating temperature over the past few days helped add up to one unstable snowpack. The virtually unprecedented mix of these particular elements resulted in the U.S. Forest Service snow ranger station, as well as Alpine Meadows' own avalanche forecaster, issuing a warning that the level of avalanche hazard on March 31 was "extreme." </p><p> Covering approximately 2,000 acres, Alpine Meadows is located in Bear Valley on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, along the Sierra Crest ridgeline, five miles north of Lake Tahoe, California. It shares its northern ridge with Squaw Valley, located one valley over. The terrain was originally heavily glaciated, which produced a series of enormous cirques separated by steep ridges. The resort's high floor -- almost 7,000 feet above sea level -- guarantees an immense amount of snow, and the ski runs range from tame to some of the country's most challenging, nearly all of which showcase a postcard view of shimmering Lake Tahoe. </p><p> Alpine Meadows was established on land leased from the Southern Pacific Land Company and the U.S. Forest Service. Soon after it opened, on December 28, 1961, the intensity of the snowfall and the steep terrain in the area caused the Forest Service to label Alpine Meadows as one of the few Class A avalanche areas in the country, the highest possible hazard designation. As a result, the resort developed one of the most proficient, experienced, and intense avalanche forecasting and control programs in the country. </p><p> Larry had been at Alpine Meadows working ski patrol on and off for the past dozen years. In 1982 the patrol was made up almost solely of men (a lone woman had signed on just a few seasons prior) and an incredibly macho bunch at that -- the type that couldn't wait to get to work in the morning and blow things up. In addition to saving lives, the main function of the Alpine Meadows ski patrol was to control avalanches, which meant throwing bombs and firing artillery into the slopes to set off small avalanches in an effort to prevent big ones. The guys on ski patrol were essentially made up of equal parts firefighter, cop, paramedic, explosives expert, mountain guide, and ski bum. Their reason for living was to make things safe, and although they took this role incredibly seriously, no one ever had more fun at their job. </p><p> The orientation alone seemed like it would have driven most prospective patrollers out of the snow for good, but on the contrary, the challenge only seemed to strengthen their resolve for the work. Larry's initiation to the danger of avalanches during his rookie season was a terrifying, sickening experience, sort of like a hazing prank gone wild. Norm Wilson, the mountain manager at the time, took Larry out to Peril Ridge to become accustomed to the feel of the snow, to learn how sometimes merely adjusting his weight at the wrong place on an unstable slope could set off an avalanche. Norm's plan was to teach Larry not merely about the potential threat of the snowpack, but also the hazards of overconfidence. Larry saw the snow in front of him hump up, and then, like a tablecloth yanked off a set table, he was knocked completely back off his feet. It wasn't a big enough slide to bury him, but it was a huge moment in his life, teaching him more in those few seconds about power and respect than he had ever learned before. The experience did not, however, deter him from wanting to be on ski patrol. </p><p> Despite Larry's passion for the work, by age 34 he figured it was just about time for him to move on and start building houses for a living. There were two men above him -- Bernie Kingery, the mountain manager, and Bob Blair, the patrol director -- who loved their jobs just as much as he did and weren't going anywhere. </p><p> Already a few feet of new snow had filled the parking lot since the previous day. There was almost no place to park, not because the lot was full of cars, but because there were massive piles of snow everywhere. One of the spots closest to the resort happened to be shoveled out, and Larry pulled in right next to the ski lodge. </p><p> As he and Thom got out of the Jeep, movement near the ground caught Larry's eye. Through the dawning light and swirling snow, he made out an owl -- definitely alive, but bouncing along the parking lot, tumbling with the wind and the blizzard. It was a small owl, maybe 8-10 inches tall, with yellow eyes and a white face outlined in brown and white. It had intricate off-white and light brown markings and no ears. </p><p> In all the time Larry had spent in the area, he had only seen an owl maybe once or twice before, at dusk, while camping deep in the forest. This particular type of owl, which he later realized was a Saw-whet owl, is secretive, strictly nocturnal, and almost never glimpsed by humans. Bird-watchers consider a sighting of this specific kind of owl to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. </p><p> The mythology of owls throughout the world is connected to a general belief that the bird is an omen of evil, and that forest owls in particular are a portent of death. For many Native Americans (especially the Apaches and the Ojibwa) and the Aboriginal people of Australia, as well as several cultures in Africa, Asia, and South America, the perception of owls involves powerful taboos with deep roots. In West Africa, the pidgin English name for owl is "witchbird." In old Armenian tales, owls were associated with the devil, and in Russian folklore, owls, especially small ones, were believed to be harbingers of deaths and disasters. Even Shakespeare, in Macbeth, describes the owl as a messenger of death, calling it "the fatal bellman" -- a night watchman who rings a bell at the door of a prisoner scheduled for execution in the morning. </p><p> Larry followed the owl that morning, trying to help it, save it, but eventually the storm blew it underneath a parked bus, and he could no longer see it. He gathered up his gear and headed in to work.

It was in the Senate Building, so it&#x2019;s either a&nbsp;fully functional security vehicle or some Senator&#x2019;s unarmed memoriesof-&nbsp;youth vehicle. I&#x2019;m hoping for the second option.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Come to two-five-nine.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; Han put the <i>Falcon </i>into a dive. His stomach fluttered, and&nbsp;the sensor screen filled up with tiny objects getting larger&#x2013;small-&nbsp;vehicle traffic at and below building-top level. Flashing down at terrifying&nbsp;and illegal speed, he twitched the controls right and left, nimbly&nbsp;dodging the much smaller civilian vehicles.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Han, what do you think&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then he was fully among them, streams of traffic above as well as&nbsp;below. He pulled out of his dive two hundred meters below the average&nbsp;height of the buildings.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;&#x2013;you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This way, we&#x2019;re off the major sensor boards.

He&nbsp;stole a starfighter; that means he wants to make space. It&#x2019;s damaged,&nbsp;so he can&#x2019;t. He needs another one. Right?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;When it comes to piloting and pilots, I&#x2019;m all-knowing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Leia put an artificial sweetness into her voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never argue with&nbsp;you again.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Han snorted and increased velocity. A Coruscant Security speeder&nbsp;following in his wake dropped back, left behind as though it were suddenly&nbsp;standing still.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke and Ben, in Ben&#x2019;s nimble red airspeeder, received the transmission&nbsp;with Han&#x2019;s guess about the spaceport.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke, at the controls, shook his head, not pleased. The spaceport,&nbsp;comparatively flat and built at a much lower altitude than the surrounding&nbsp;residential, business, and government zones, was not, as&nbsp;most supposed, actually situated at bedrock level. Below it were many&nbsp;levels of machinery, repair hangars, Empire-era emergency bunkers,&nbsp;spaceport employee facilities, and repair accesses.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;If Han was right and Valin was headed that way, even if he was unsuccessful&nbsp;at stealing another spaceworthy vehicle he might escape into&nbsp;those subterranean regions, making it hard or impossible to find him&nbsp;before he detected his tracking device and destroyed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Their speeder emerged from the skytowers and was abruptly out&nbsp;over the flatter region surrounding the spaceport. It was mostly given&nbsp;over to speeder parking, though it had decorative elements, including&nbsp;tree-spotted grassy regions and a small artificial lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And sensor stations. Almost immediately, the speeder&#x2019;s comm&nbsp;board began blaring with instructions for them to turn back, to stay&nbsp;away from restricted airspace.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Tell them who we are.&#x201d; Luke had to raise his voice to a shout to&nbsp;be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I bet it doesn&#x2019;t work. Who&#x2019;s on the news as a criminal suspect?&nbsp;You are.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do it anyway.&#x201d; Luke put the speeder into a holding pattern, keeping&nbsp;close to the ring of skytowers, not approaching the port itself. The&nbsp;authorities might well decide to shoot down a suspicious speeder&#x2013;&nbsp;piloted by a suspected criminal or not&#x2013;heading straight toward an invaluable&nbsp;government and civilian transportation resource. Sabotage&nbsp;and terror attacks had taken place as recently as the war, two years earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Ben looked up from the comm board, startled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not the only&nbsp;ones.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Luke scanned the airspace above the spaceport.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There were a <i>lot </i>of small vehicles there now, most of them&nbsp;airspeeders of one size or another. Some were bigger business vehicles,&nbsp;many with lettering and symbols on the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>From the utility compartment, Ben pulled out a pair of macro -&nbsp;binoculars and held them to his eyes. &#x201c;That one&#x2019;s a press vehicle.&nbsp;Turret-mounted holocam on top. That one&#x2013;hey, that&#x2019;s Jaina. The big&nbsp;green one&#x2013;oh, kriff.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Language. What is it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;It has an oversized driver&#x2019;s cab and that Skakoan is in it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke frowned. Suddenly everyone knew that Valin was coming&nbsp;here, including press and bounty hunters. That meant open comm&nbsp;channels were being monitored, and people with no business being&nbsp;here were up to date. Daala&#x2019;s people had to be doing this.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Then he saw it, almost at ground level, an X-wing painted in classic&nbsp;First Galactic Civil War grays. Its running lights were off; it was illuminated&nbsp;only by the glows from parking area pole lights&#x2013;it flew beneath&nbsp;the altitude of the lights themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d; Luke pushed his control yoke forward, sending the&nbsp;speeder into a precipitous dive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ben&#x2019;s lips were drawn back in a grimace&#x2013;perhaps because no&nbsp;teenager wants anyone else to endanger his vehicle recklessly, that&nbsp;being the teenager&#x2019;s own prerogative&#x2013;but said, &#x201c;<i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s incoming.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Luke put the speeder on an intercept course, or a collision&nbsp;course if anything went wrong, and switched the autopilot on. He unlatched&nbsp;his seat restraints and slid toward Ben. &#x201c;Take the controls.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He was gratified to see his son&#x2019;s eyes open wide, but Ben did as he&nbsp;was told; the boy unbuckled, slid under his father, grabbed the controls,&nbsp;disengaged the autopilot.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke stood up in the seat, drawing on the Force to keep him&nbsp;pinned in place despite the rush of wind threatening to tear him free.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He counted on Ben to know what to do, and his son did not let&nbsp;him down. Ben leveled off at the same altitude as the X-wing, completing&nbsp;his maneuver just meters behind the starfighter, and drew&nbsp;alongside that vehicle&#x2019;s port side.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Luke sprang across the gap separating his seat from the cockpit.&nbsp;The wind threatened to whip him away, but a boost of Force energy&nbsp;carried him to the fuselage just as Valin Horn was realizing he had a&nbsp;pace vehicle. Luke landed astride the nose, facing astern, staring&nbsp;straight down into Valin&#x2019;s startled features.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Valin yanked up on the X-wing&#x2019;s armrests. The canopy was suddenly&nbsp;open, snapping backward, and gone, and Valin hurtled into the&nbsp;sky, his pilot&#x2019;s chair propelled by a crude one-use rocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stang! He punched out.&#x201d; Han pounded his steering yoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leia looked as aggravated as Han felt. &#x201c;Can the cargo tractor&nbsp;beam&#x2013;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Not strong enough. Can&#x2019;t compensate for a fast-moving target.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;We have to go after Valin, then.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Han shook his head. &#x201c;The ejection won&#x2019;t have left enough controls&nbsp;for Luke to land the X-wing. He may be able to lift it or push it down&nbsp;with the Force . . . but land it with no controls? No. We have to help&nbsp;him.&#x201d; He heeled over, diving toward the X-wing.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He punched out.&#x201d; Jaina reluctantly turned her attention from Luke,&nbsp;disappearing toward the spaceport on the uncontrolled X-wing, and&nbsp;returned it to Valin, still ascending in his ejection seat. She banked and&nbsp;headed toward the rogue Jedi.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;In the passenger seat, Master Kyle Katarn, about Luke&#x2019;s age, darkhaired&nbsp;and dark-bearded, stretched as if coming out of a nap. &#x201c;You&nbsp;plan to maneuver underneath and catch him?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Katarn pointed toward another speeder, a large, flatbed cargo&nbsp;hauler with figures standing in the cargo bed. This vehicle rose toward&nbsp;Valin&#x2019;s position from a much nearer position. &#x201c;So do they.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Valin&#x2019;s seat reached its maximum altitude and began dropping. Immediately&nbsp;the short-term repulsor within the seat activated, slowing his&nbsp;descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt as though he&#x2019;d taken a tremendous blow to the top of his&nbsp;head, doing no damage to it but compressing the spine beneath. Ejections&nbsp;were always like that&#x2013;bad, but better than the alternative.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;And he&#x2019;d always relish the look...</p><h2>Waiting for the King of Spain</h2><p>Six sequences of poems relate the poet&#39;s life, experiences, and observations to those of historical figures of exalted and common rank</p><p></p><h2>Funeral in Berlin</h2><p><p>A ferociously cool Cold War thriller from the author of The Ipcress File.</p><p>Len Deighton&#x2019;s third novel has become a classic, as compelling and suspenseful now as when it first exploded on to the bestseller lists.</p><p>In Berlin, where neither side of the wall is safe, Colonel Stok of Red Army Security is prepared to sell an important Russian scientist to the West &#x2013; for a price.

Now, in a finger-on-the-pulse examination of this growing trend, Deirdre Bair, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and winner of the National Book Award, explores the many reasons why older, long-married couples break up. Having conducted nearly four hundred interviews with ex-wives, ex-husbands, and their adult children, Bair reveals some of the surprising motivations that lead to these drastic late-life splits, as well as the surprising turns life takes for all concerned after the divorce is final. <br><br>Although the standard assumption is that husbands trade in their spouses for younger trophy wives, Bair has found that, most often, women initiate these divorces because they want the freedom to control how they will live the rest of their lives. The realization may appear to happen suddenly, but Bair shows how it often takes many years and much careful planning before the ultimate &#x201c;Eureka!&#x201d; moment. We see that for one woman it happened when she asked her husband to help in the kitchen and he shouted angrily for her to keep her voice down so he could hear the television. For one couple, the decision to end their marriage arrived when the wife condemned their unmarried adult daughter for having a baby and her husband sided with the daughter, leading both partners to realize that they had never had anything in common. One woman in her eighties, married for fifty-three years, woke up after transplant surgery and announced to her husband: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how many years I have left, but I do know I don&#x2019;t want to spend them with you.&#x201d; <br><br>Bair describes current trends in late-life divorece, including the growing use of &#x201c;mediators,&#x201d; whom many couples see as lower-cost alternatives to lawyers. She also provides fascinating examples of how people cope in the years after divorce. Divorce changes older peoples&#x2019; sex lives in surprising ways, and Bair is candid in discussing what really goes on in their bedrooms. She presents the stories of those who elect to stay single after divorce, of others who remarry immediately, and of those who are puzzled to find themselves divorcing yet again. As Bair&#x2019;s subjects rebuild their lives, the reader wills see new possibilities for living in &#x201c;the third age,&#x201d; and may be inspired to realize that there is indeed life after divorce&#x2013;and plenty of it.<br><br>Important, eye-opening, and truly groundbreaking, <i>Calling It Quits</i> is essential reading for an entire generation and its children,&#x2013;and an acclaimed author&#x2019;s most personal and most universal work.</p><p>Deirdre Bair is the critically acclaimed author of four previous works of nonfiction. She received the National Book Award for <i>Samuel Beckett: A Biography</i>, and her biographies of Ana�s Nin and Simone de Beauvoir were also prize finalists. Her biography of C. G. Jung was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and received the Gradiva Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. She has been awarded fellowships from (among others) the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations and the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College. She has been a literary journalist and university professor of comparative literature and now divides her time between New York and Connecticut.The inspiration for this book came from a magazine survey on late-life divorce in <i>AARP</i> that Bair came across in her dentist's waiting room. It hit a chord with Bair, whose own marriage had ended in divorce after 43 years, and she set out to find the stories behind the statistics. Bair, an award-winning literary biographer (<i>Samuel Beckett</i>), turned her sights on a group of men, women and adult children who have been affected by late-life divorce. She found that more divorces were initiated by women, which puts into question the assumptions both that men always leave for younger women and that ex-wives seldom find love again. But the several hundred North Americans and Europeans Bair talked to hardly constitute what she terms a "social earthquake." Nor does Bair offer any advice or answers as to why some long-term marriages go on the rocks. (Curiously, the divorce she stands to have the most insight into&#x2014;her own&#x2014;she is less than forthcoming about.) Bair's intent is simply to ask questions in the hope of furthering a dialogue on the subject. Readers will not find answers, but those going through a late-life divorce will encounter personal stories, all-too human ones, that they will identify with. <i>(Jan. 30)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Self-determination, resistance, and cultural maintenance are the recurring themes in the lives and struggles of Nuevomexicanos from 1848 to the present. The conflict has been not solely with the customs and institutions Anglos introduced--though certainly that has occurred. On a more fundamental level, the clash has been over modernization--how the Spanish language, folk traditions, and land grants can survive as a heritage for future generations amid English, new and secular values, and real estate booms and speculation. </p><p>Nuevomexicanos have confronted colonialism, ethnocentrism, and racism throughout their history. But as these essays make clear, pride in Spanish descent runs deep in New Mexico and has led to a vibrancy unmatched in any other region in the United States. Nuevomexicanos have not simply survived or endured. They have secured their influence through the highest level of education among all Chicanos in the United States, through greater political representation at the local and national level--and in both major parties--than in any other state, and through a culture that has simultaneously resisted and adapted to change.</p><br><p>"This collection is a first in taking a Chicano perspective. . . .

But there&#x2019;s a catch. We must be smart enough--evolved enough--to leverage change. We must get beyond our &#x201c;farmer&#x201d; roots and find our inner &#x201c;hunter.&#x201d;<br><br>Ten thousand years ago, something changed. Someone planted the first seeds, ushering in a new era. Humankind had a reliable source of food, eliminating the time-consuming need to seek out wild plants and hunt animals nomadically. People could stay put, build communities, and acquire possessions. Over the next five hundred generations, predictability and protecting order became paramount. We evolved into excellent farmers. It&#x2019;s this simple: Once we find a field to farm, we&#x2019;re neurologically wired to repeat the chain of decisions that led to the last harvest. Today, you can see this wiring in the way most corporations behave. Once a company becomes successful, it creates rules, procedures, and policies to protect the status quo.<br><br>Everyone farms. Your &#x201c;field&#x201d; might be your job, your product, or your brand, but reflexively, when you find a fertile field, you farm. Your neurological preferences take over and you become protective of your craft, digging in for what you hope will be a repeat of the prior harvest.<br><br>While this tendency served us well for the last ten thousand years, it leaves us unprepared for today&#x2019;s era of rapid change. To break free, we need to better understand our farming bias and learn how to awaken our inner hunter. Yes, it&#x2019;s tempting to think, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m already a hunter. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m reading this book. Why can&#x2019;t I just hear about those patterns and get going already!&#x201d; But there&#x2019;s immense danger in that impatience. If you fall into the traps of the farmer, you won&#x2019;t be able to fully exploit the patterns. So listen up.<br>THE FARMER: COUGH SYRUP, AWKWARD MOMENTS, AND SEX APPEAL<br><br>Roy Raymond was a 1970s version of today&#x2019;s ambitious California entrepreneurs. He was a Stanford business grad on the lookout for a commercial concept he could call his own, and he wasn&#x2019;t finding it pursuing a career at Vicks, the over-the-counter cough syrup company. One day, on a mission to find a gift for his wife, he entered the intimate apparel section of a local department store. The experience was awkward, to say the least. He felt like &#x201c;an unwelcome intruder,&#x201d; embarrassed and lost in &#x201c;racks of terry-cloth robes and ugly, floral-print nylon nightgowns.&#x201d;1<br><br>The discomfort led to an idea: Why not create a guy-friendly shop in which men could buy lingerie for their girlfriends or wives? His idea was rooted in two insights: first, that a lingerie shop geared toward men would make them more comfortable shopping, and second, that truly sexy lingerie would be a hit with both men and women.<br><br>In 1977, Raymond begged and borrowed $80,000 from his relatives to launch a little lingerie shop. With its wood-paneled walls, fashionable clothing, and upscale, male-oriented theme, the shop racked up sales of half a million dollars in its first year. That success funded three more locations. Aiming to go national, Raymond launched a mail-order catalog that was the talk of the industry and won additional notice when it was pinned up in men&#x2019;s locker rooms everywhere. Within a few years, he was adding new locations and reaping millions in revenue.<br><br>By now, you&#x2019;ve probably guessed that Raymond&#x2019;s store was Victoria&#x2019;s Secret, although little remains of Raymond&#x2019;s business model in the international chain we know today. Raymond did many things correctly, including transforming a broken shopping experience into a lucrative retail concept and exploiting an untapped niche, for which he reaped the rewards. But, despite those smart moves, he didn&#x2019;t see the bigger picture. It turned out, of course, that women buy most lingerie, not men--so Raymond was marketing to the wrong sex. Indeed, the main reason that women shopped at his stores was the fashionable lingerie, but not specifically because it made men happy. Rather, because it made women feel more confident. Raymond missed all that, and eventually his chain was headed for bankruptcy. That&#x2019;s when retailing magnate Leslie Wexner took the enterprise off his hands.<br><br>Within months, the new managers radically repositioned the stores and catalogue: imagery, brand, colors, and styles were all redesigned for a woman&#x2019;s eye, and the fresh, female-empowering approach worked like a charm. The result: Three decades later, Victoria&#x2019;s Secret has grown into a $6 billion megabrand.<br><br>It would be easy to dismiss Raymond&#x2019;s talents based on the scale of his blunder. You might argue that he was overlooking the obvious, but don&#x2019;t forget that his initial stores made millions. He had a proven formula, and he stuck by it for years.<br><br>Unfortunately, like many individuals and teams, Raymond was only too happy to play the role of the farmer. Had he experimented more and been willing to cast aside his strongly held beliefs, he might have taken full advantage of the tremendous opportunities his company was poised to exploit.<br><br>What opportunities are you missing right now? How many breakthrough business ideas are just a few steps away from what you&#x2019;re already working on? The reality is that you can&#x2019;t know. Unlike Raymond, most of us will never see someone else come and do our job so much better.<br><br>While Raymond&#x2019;s failure was catastrophic, his shortcomings are common among businesses and entrepreneurs. Raymond suffered from the three farmer traps: He was complacent with his own success, repetitive, and overly protective of his own beliefs.<br><br>As strange as it may sound, one of the hard-to-fathom lessons from these traps is that &#x201c;being good&#x201d; at something may eventually keep you from reaching your full potential.<br>THE HUNTER: COUTURE, BLUE JEANS, AND NO PHOTOGRAPHS<br><br>To understand how to skirt these common traps, let&#x2019;s meet an unlikely hunter, a seventy-eight-year-old man who lives in the bustling Spanish port city of A Coruna. He wears the same blue outfit nearly every day. He eats lunch in his work cafeteria and rarely goes on vacation. He doesn&#x2019;t do interviews. In fact, until 1999, no published photograph existed of this mysterious man.<br><br>Indeed, the only reason he finally deigned to be photographed at all was that he had to as part of his company&#x2019;s initial public offering. He earned his billions by revolutionizing fashion, and today, he&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s third-wealthiest individual, richer than Warren Buffet and Larry Ellison, and just behind Carlos Slim and Bill Gates.<br><br>Amancio Ortega is the creator of Zara, a thriving international chain of clothing stores that you might mistakenly think is like any other, except that it&#x2019;s completely different. Louis Vuitton&#x2019;s fashion director calls Zara &#x201c;possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world.&#x201d;2 The company doesn&#x2019;t advertise because it can&#x2019;t and doesn&#x2019;t need to. Zara doesn&#x2019;t carry every design and size in stock, and styles are rarely consistent. And that&#x2019;s precisely why it succeeds.<br><br>To understand how Zara has made Ortega fabulously wealthy is to understand the future of business--in any industry. This is not a lesson in fashion.<br><br>It starts with speed. An average clothing company takes several months or up to a year to turn a design into a product ready for purchase. Zara takes just fourteen days.3<br><br>Designers and pattern makers craft several concepts throughout each day, which the company speedily manufactures from its local factory. Outsourcing to China is not an option, because distance would delay production. Zara often starts by working with greige textiles, meaning that they are in an unfinished, near-colorless state. Working with textiles in such a state means that they can be dyed at the last minute.<br><br>If Zara&#x2019;s latest inspiration is a little red dress with a collar, five sizes of that design will be crafted and shipped to each of Zara&#x2019;s 2,000 stores--all within two weeks. Buy that red dress and a salesclerk will ask why you like it. Such questions might seem innocuous, but at the end of the day, the legions of storekeepers report back to the head office. If enough women like the dress but aren&#x2019;t crazy about the collar, the designer will bang out a fresh collar-free design, and in fourteen days, it will hit all 2,000 stores.<br><br>Slim inventory has multiple benefits. The company is seldom stuck with clothing it can&#x2019;t sell, and advertising is unnecessary, irrelevant, and impossible because there&#x2019;s no logic in putting a dress on a billboard if it won&#x2019;t be available next week. And finally, the limited supply reinforces exclusivity. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough to snare this week&#x2019;s hot new skirt, great, but if you hesitate, it may never be in the store again. This sparks urgency, tapping into the predator-prey psychology that hooks so many shoppers. Customers also take comfort in knowing that coworkers are unlikely to show up to work in the same dress.<br><br>These unusual methods have helped Zara become one of the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing and most disruptive retailers. In an article on the company, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported that the opening of a Zara store is the &#x201c;signifier of a stylish city,&#x201d; and it quoted one young woman as saying, &#x201c;Thank God, we won&#x2019;t be a third-world fashion country any more.&#x201d;4<br><br>Unlike the &#x201c;farmer&#x201d; archetype I&#x2019;ve described, Ortega is not complacent. He is insatiable. In his words, whether you&#x2019;re a designer or a storekeeper, &#x201c;the daily task is marked by self-improvement and the search for new opportunity.&#x201d; Ortega doesn&#x2019;t lapse into repetition. Nor is he protective of his fashionable designs. He is relentlessly curious and willing to destroy.<br><br>These are the three hunter instincts--insatiability, curiosity, and willingness to destroy.<br>AWAKENING YOUR INNER HUNTER<br><br>While these may sound like simple concepts, putting them into practice is another matter. The first step is to awaken, a process that I was reminded of during a pre-event phone call for a corporate keynote. The company CEO pumped me up Tony Robbins style, despite the fact that I was the one hired to deliver the motivational talk.<br><br>He heads a multibillion-dollar insurance company that is growing, though not as fast as his shareholders might like. He wasted no time: &#x201c;Can I be candid with you? Can we just talk like we&#x2019;re a couple girls hanging out in a locker room?&#x201d; I thought, &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t get that reference . . . but sure.&#x201d;<br><br>He continued with a salty diatribe that ramped up like a speech delivered by a tough football coach whose team is down at halftime. &#x201c;Our brand is like a lion. We grew up kings. We claimed our land. But now we&#x2019;re that same big lion and we&#x2019;re sleeping under a tree. People come to work, earn their keep, pay the mortgage, and go home. We&#x2019;re good, but not great. We&#x2019;ve lost our hunger. We&#x2019;re a lion sitting under the tree, watching the hyenas as they stalk our territory. They&#x2019;re coming right up to us. They scratch. They push. They&#x2019;re eating our food! At a certain point, we need to remember that we&#x2019;re a f***ing lion. We need to stand up, and we need to f***ing roar!&#x201d;<br><br>Complacency was the enemy of this hunter, and he was more than aware of it--he was obsessed. &#x201c;Things need to change,&#x201d; the CEO growled, &#x201c;and they need to change now. People are either with me in the new world order, or they&#x2019;re not. And that might mean that not everyone is right for the job anymore. It might mean that the people change. But one thing is certain,&#x201d; he thundered. &#x201c;We are hunters, and now is our time to hunt!&#x201d;<br><br>Many of today&#x2019;s mightiest companies are great lions. They have the ability to claim new territory fiercely, but once they do, they&#x2019;re often tempted to take a break and bask in their glory. Kings of the jungle, they can&#x2019;t imagine being dethroned. That attitude doesn&#x2019;t go unnoticed. The rest of the animal kingdom picks up on this complacency. They smell it and know it. The hyenas become a little more daring and hungry.<br><br>Confronted with a business world no longer defined by stability and predictability, you need to adapt. It&#x2019;s time to step out of the shadows of your predecessors--time to sharpen your weapons. Hunters look for clues, listen for footsteps, and scan for the scents that lead to opportunity. If your spear misses its target, throw another or fashion a better weapon. Hunters constantly reassess signals and seek new patterns that will help them track their next prey.<br><br>Now is the time to awaken your inner hunter. Dart in. Feast as the lion dozes! Create a culture of speed and recognize that your key advantage is the ability to understand your customer, adapt, and fashion fast solutions.<br><br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter how big you are. Stand up, claim what&#x2019;s yours, and roar.<br>Chapter 2<br><br>FARMER TRAPS VS. HUNTER INSTINCTS<br><br>Awakening your inner hunter, as I&#x2019;ve discussed, requires you to better understand farmer traps. It also requires you to develop instincts to avoid those traps.<br>FARMER TRAP #1: COMPLACENCY<br><br>Thirty years ago, baby boomers launched their blue-chip careers confident that their large, stable employers would steadily increase their salaries for the rest of their working days. That world is gone. Today, even well-managed companies fail to adapt, largely because of the complacency that so often insidiously worms itself into a firm&#x2019;s culture.<br><br>In my first book, Exploiting Chaos, I wrote of an iconic, game-changing company that reinvented communication. Innovation was in the company&#x2019;s blood: It invented the spell checker, grammar checker, and laptop word-processor. In 1989, the company hauled in half a billion dollars in revenue and was still growing. Most people would guess that I&#x2019;m referring to Apple, Microsoft, HP, IBM, or Xerox, but those aren&#x2019;t even close. The company was Smith Corona, the best typewriter company in the world.<br><br>Smith Corona did dabble in computing in a 1990 joint venture with Acer. But less than two years later, Smith Corona&#x2019;s CEO abruptly canceled the foray, noting, &#x201c;Many people believe that the typewriter and word-processor business is a buggy-whip industry, which is far from true. There is still a strong market for our products in the United States and the world.&#x201d;5<br><br>The CEO&#x2019;s foolish choice of words, horrible timing, and lack of foresight were extraordinary. Three years later, Smith Corona declared bankruptcy, and Acer went on to become, at one point, the world&#x2019;s second-largest PC company.<br><br>Smith Corona is not alone. Over the decades, many once-dominant corporations have fallen from grace. For example, there was a time when corporate yuppies gleefully bragged about their BlackBerry addictions. To maintain its leading position, BlackBerry (originally called Research in Motion) built a strong business brand that boasted unparalleled security and reliability. These qualities provided the company with the equivalent of a medieval castle&#x2019;s moat, blocking competitors from entering the corporate market. But BlackBerry&#x2019;s inward focus and complacency blinded the company to the potential of the rapidly expanding consumer market. And that nearsightedness spelled its doom. Mainstream non&#x2013;business consumers rushed to stylish offerings from Apple and Samsung. Gradually, the upstarts also improved their security and reliability and ate away at BlackBerry&#x2019;s beloved corporate market. It was the knockout punch Blackberry didn&#x2019;t see coming, sending it into a vicious downward spiral.<br><br>1 Emily Newhall, &#x201c;A Catalog-Business Boom,&#x201d; Newsweek, November 16, 1981.<br><br>2 &#x201c;Zara, a Spanish Success Story,&#x201d; CNN, June 15, 2001, http://edition.cnn.com/BUSINESS/programs/yourbusiness/stories2001/zara.<br><br>3 &#x201c;The Reclusive Billionaire: Secret Life of Zara Boss Amancio Ortega and His &#x2018;Fast Fashion&#x2019; Empire,&#x201d; The Age, March 5, 2013, http...</p><h2>Gratins: Golden-Crusted Sweet and Savory Dishes</h2><p>With their crusty tops and tantalizingly soft interiors, gratins are the perfect comfort food and ideal one-dish meal for everyday.

Over twenty years ago I wrote <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, to try to explain where the universe came from, and where it is going. But that book left some important questions unanswered. Why is there a universe--why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? Why are the laws of nature what they are? Did the universe need a designer and creator?</p> <p>It was Einstein&#x2019;s dream to discover the grand design of the universe, a single theory that explains everything. However, physicists in Einstein&#x2019;s day hadn&#x2019;t made enough progress in understanding the forces of nature for that to be a realistic goal. And by the time I had begun writing <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, there were still several key advances that had not yet been made that would prevent us from fulfilling Einstein&#x2019;s dream. But in recent years the development of M-theory, the top-down approach to cosmology, and new observations such as those made by satellites like NASA&#x2019;s COBE and WMAP, have brought us closer than ever to that single theory, and to being able to answer those deepest of questions. And so Leonard Mlodinow and I set out to write a sequel to <em>A Brief History of Time</em> to attempt to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. The result is <em>The Grand Design</em>, the product of our four-year effort.</p> <p>In <em>The Grand Design</em> we explain why, according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence, or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. We question the conventional concept of reality, posing instead a "model-dependent" theory of reality. We discuss how the laws of our particular universe are extraordinarily finely tuned so as to allow for our existence, and show why quantum theory predicts the multiverse--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. And we assess M-Theory, an explanation of the laws governing the multiverse, and the <em>only</em> viable candidate for a complete "theory of everything." As we promise in our opening chapter, unlike the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life given in the <em>Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the answer we provide in <em>The Grand Design</em> is not, simply, "42."</p> <p>(Photo � Philip Waterson, LBIPP, LRPS)</p>STEPHEN HAWKING held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663, for thirty years.

Now that he was unemployed it was hard to fill all the hours in a day. His new life hadn't turned out remotely the way he'd imagined when he'd planned to start over. He missed the people he'd known before, wanted to contact some of them&#x2014; but they thought he was dead and they had to go on thinking that.<br><br>Maybe that was why, after so many years, he'd looked up his high-school sweetheart and followed her to California. The compulsion to reconnect didn't make much sense otherwise. He'd moved on without her quite easily twenty years ago. Married twice, divorced once and...<br><br>He didn't want to think about what he'd done to his second wife. He didn't regret killing her or her son. As far as he was concerned, they deserved what they got. But ever since he'd gambled away most of the insurance settlement he'd taken when he left Jersey, he'd been forced to live in dumpy rental houses out in the boondocks where the smell of cow shit was so strong it sometimes felt as if he was standing in it. Tough to find something better when the only jobs he could get were at two-bit security companies that paid a buck or two over minimum wage.<br><br>With a silent curse, he remembered the last job he'd held. It wasn't the meager pay that bothered him so much as the lack of respect. He couldn't take it; not after being a real cop.<br><br>Fingering the badge he still carried everywhere, he slid to the next window so he could have a better view of Mary checking her computer. She was probably expecting to hear from him. Claiming to be someone she'd once met briefly, he'd contacted her through her jewelry-making Web site and managed to strike up a relationship.<br><br>But hiding behind an alias and a computer screen wasn't satisfying him tonight. He was bored, restless....<br><br>After only a few minutes at the computer, Mary stood and started turning off the lights. With the kids in school and her job at the hospital, she was pretty damned predictable. From here, she'd go into her bedroom, pull the blinds and the show would be over.<br><br>Unless she didn't bother with the blinds. In the months he'd been watching her, she'd forgotten only once, but that gave him hope.<br><br>Creeping around to the other side of the house, he squatted in the shrubbery and waited for her to enter her bedroom.<br><br>She came in, turned on the TV, put away some clothes that were folded and sitting on a chair. Then she approached the window. They were only inches apart, so close he could see the mascara smudges that told him she'd been rubbing her eyes&#x2014;<br><br>Then the blind went down.<br><br><em>Shit. </em>Malcolm sank lower on his haunches. What now? Should he head to the Indian casinos and while away a few hours?<br><br>No. He needed something more visceral, something more exciting, something to remind him of the power he'd once enjoyed.<br><br>He toyed with the idea of slipping into the house, exploring the empty rooms, touching Mary's things, stealing a pair of her panties. Maybe even watching her sleep. The temptation to do so was growing stronger every day. He certainly thought about it a lot. But he was afraid he'd get caught and screw up the possibility of having a real relationship with her once he could trust her enough to reveal his true identity. He'd come too far to blow all that by being impatient....<br><br>He had to leave. But that didn't mean he had to call it a night. Thinking of the Kojak light he kept in his van, he felt his mood improve. Playing cop wouldn't put him in Mary's bed tonight, but it would give him the adrenaline rush he craved&#x2014;and maybe a few sexual favors to go with it.<br><br><em>Three weeks later...</em><br><br>Jane Burke recognized an opportunity when she saw one. Ever since she'd started working at The Last Stand, she'd been waiting for her chance, hoping a case would come along that would allow her to prove herself.<br><br>She was pretty sure it had just walked through the door.<br><br>"The man who let me in said you might be able to help me." A short cannonball of a woman stood uncertainly in the entryway of Jane's office, swiping at tear-filled eyes.<br><br>Motioning for her to come farther into the room, Jane brought over a box of tissues. "I'll do my best," she promised. "But first I need to learn more about why you're here."<br><br>The young woman's obesity made it difficult to guess her age, but Jane pegged her at twenty-four or twenty-five. Gerald, the volunteer who'd admitted her, had told Jane she had two siblings who'd recently gone missing. So far, that was all Jane knew. If it'd been on the news, she hadn't seen it or heard about it. But that wasn't too surprising. She'd been so busy she hadn't even turned on the TV. "What's your name?"<br><br>In an attempt to control her emotions, the woman took two tissues and blew her nose. "Gloria. Gloria Rickman."<br><br>"Gloria, I'm Jane Burke. Please sit down so we can talk." Jane returned the tissue box to its generally ignored corner, then pulled a chair away from the wall, placing it in front of the desk, where it would've been if she'd been in the habit of taking her own cases. She was still in training, had been since she'd started six months ago, which meant she did all the tedious record searches, time-consuming court runs and boring clerical work for the three partners who were the backbone of the victims' charity. But she had a feeling the criminal justice courses she'd been taking, and everything she'd learned on the job, was about to pay off. With Skye Willis and Ava Trussell in South America on a rare job-for-hire, tracking a father who'd stolen his child from his ex-wife, and Sheridan Granger out on maternity leave, Jane had been left in charge of the office. This was the perfect time to tackle her first case. Other than the three volunteers who came in to stuff envelopes or solicit donations, she was the only person here.<br><br>"Let me get a notebook. Then I want you to tell me what's upset you so much."<br><br>The chair creaked as the woman settled into it. Rolls of flesh spilled over the wooden frame, but Jane didn't care about her excess weight. She'd once been heavy herself. Maybe not quite to this degree, but definitely frumpy. If not for the counseling, daily workout sessions and self-defense classes that'd become her routine&#x2014;all a product in one way or another of her friendship with Skye&#x2014;she'd probably still be the disillusioned, overweight, hard-edged smoker she'd been four years ago.<br><br>Now she ran an hour a day, weighed a trim one hundred and ten pounds, and had stopped trying to kill herself with cigarettes. Only her smoker's voice remained. And the scars from that period of her life, of course. They'd never go away entirely&#x2014;especially the ones on the inside.<br><br>"I'm here 'bout my two sisters," Gloria said. "They went missin' three weeks ago."<br><br>"Three <em>weeks </em>ago?" Jane echoed, unable to hide her shock.<br><br>Tears welled up again. "Three weeks ago las' Saturday."<br><br>It was Monday morning. That added another day, almost two.<br><br>"Why haven't I heard about this?"<br><br>"I don't know. There were articles in the paper. I reported it to the police the same afternoon it happened," she said, "but the detective who called me ain't found nothin' yet. He's been tryin', but... no one's got any idea where my sisters are an'... I'm so scared. That's why I'm here. I have to do somethin' more. I can't jus' sit around an' wait. I'm all they have. I'm all they ever had."<br><br>"Where're your parents?"<br><br>"We have different fathers, but none of 'em are any good," she said. "Our mother didn't hang with the best crowd, you hear what I'm sayin'? She died of a drug overdose when I was twenty-three. I was the oldest and had my own place, so I moved my sisters in with me. Latisha, the youngest, wasn't even in high school yet."<br><br>Jane could easily identify with being raised by another member of the family. Her parents had been killed in a car accident when she was six, leaving her to be raised by an aging aunt who'd stayed single her entire life and had since died, as well. "Where do you live?"<br><br>"In a one-bedroom apartment on Marconi. We been there since they came to live with me. It's a small place, but we make it work. I won't uproot 'em again and again and again, like what my mama did to me."<br><br>"It's wonderful that you've been able to provide some stability," Jane said. "How long ago did you assume responsibility for them?"<br><br>"It's been 'bout three years now. They eighteen and seventeen. They both graduated this last June," she stated proudly. "Marcie got her GED, but Latisha, she was put up a grade on account of she's so smart. She graduated with honors and won a scholarship to Sac State."<br><br>So the missing sisters were, for the most part, adults. That was probably why this case hadn't become a major focus for the media. That and the fact that there'd been nothing more to report. "Did you have an argument with them? Try to punish them? Anything that might've made them angry enough to leave?"<br><br>"We argue all the time, but that ain't what's wrong, Ms.&#x2014;"<br><br>"Jane. You can call me Jane."<br><br>"They ain't never left before. They know I yell 'cause I want 'em to be more and have more than our mother. They gotta go to college. They keep tryin' to drop out so they can help me keep a roof over our heads. It's tough to earn a livin' workin' at a convenience store. I put in a good sixty, seventy hours a week. But I got Marcie's tuition at ARC to pay for, in<br><br>addition to all the other bills. They're what make it worth doin'&#x2014;knowin' they'll have a better life if I keep goin'. I can't lose 'em." More tears streaked her bronze cheeks. "We been through too much. It can't end like this."<br><br>Already Jane feared she might be in over her head. <em>Be careful what you wish for, </em>she silently chided herself. She'd been bugging Skye to let her start taking on her own cases, and Skye kept saying she wasn't ready. But if she didn't get involved now, Gloria would have to wait for Skye and Ava to return. Depending on what happened in South America, that could take a week to ten days, maybe longer. With the economy the way it was, donations were down by a significant margin. Skye and Ava needed to finish this job in order to keep the charity's doors open. That was the only reason Skye's husband had agreed to her going so far away. He was the one who'd insisted Ava go with her, since he couldn't take the time off work. They wouldn't be back until the woman who'd contracted them had her child back. And Sheridan, their other partner, was planning to spend the next three or four months at home with her new baby.<br><br>"Have you been in touch with all their friends?" Jane asked. "Do you have any other family in the area?"<br><br>"I talked to everybody. I been on the phone night an' day. Ain't nobody seen 'em."<br><br>"When's the last time you had contact?"<br><br>"That same Saturday. Latisha was sleepin' when I had Marcie take me to work. Latisha had to wait tables at noon and Marcie had to be at the Rancho Cordova Marriott at three. She's a maid." She leaned forward, as if taking Jane into her confidence. "I let 'em work part-time if they're keepin' up with their schoolwork and all." She rocked back. "Anyway, Latisha never showed up at the restaurant. I didn't know 'cause nobody called me. But when Marcie didn't go to work like she always does, the hotel wanted to know what was what. I tried her cell, but it kept goin' to voice mail."<br><br>"So you're thinking they disappeared from your apartment?"<br><br>"No. As soon as I could get someone to cover the store, I took the bus home and foun' the house jus' fine, locked up an' everythin'. But the car was gone. We have a little Honda Civic."<br><br>Jane made a note of this information. "Is there any chance your sisters could be into drugs, Gloria?"<br><br>"Oh, no! You think I'd let <em>that </em>happen after I watched my mama kill herself with that shit? After all I done to raise 'em up good? They wouldn't dare. They know I'd kick their asses clear to kingdom come."<br><br>Jane believed she would, too. "Where do you think they might've driven?"<br><br>Gloria's double chin wagged as she shook her head. "With the price of gas, they had no business goin' nowhere. We gotta pinch pennies jus' to survive. Mosta the time, we take the bus. But maybe Marcie decided to buy some doughnuts and a paper. She been talkin' 'bout gettin' a new job, a better one. That's my best guess, since the car was found near Hank's Donuts. Hank's is our favorite."<br><br>Jane quickly tried to assemble the scenario in her mind. Car abandoned; girls missing. Both sisters were going to school and working. They were also living in an environment that wasn't easy by any stretch of the imagination, but it was very apparent that they were at least loved. What could've gone wrong?<br><br>"What condition was the car in? Did it have a flat, a breakdown?" she asked.<br><br>"That car has one problem after another. It ain't worth but a few hundred bucks. But the police found it parked on a residential street off Franklin Boulevard, a few blocks from the doughnut place, like I said. And it was runnin'jus' fine."<br><br>"Was there anything inside to indicate where your sisters had been that morning&#x2014;some napkins from Hank's? A grocery sack? A Starbucks cup?"<br><br></p><h2>'GREAT SEA STORIES - THE CRUEL SEA, THE SHIP &amp; DIVE IN THE SUN'</h2><p>GREAT SEA STORIES - THE CRUEL SEA, THE SHIP &amp; DIVE IN THE SUN' [Hardcover] [Jan 01, 1980] 'NICHOLAS MONSARRAT, C.

In a lively historical narrative, Penny van Oosterzee tells the story of his achievement. His legacy is the Wallace Line, a faunal barrier separating the Asian from the Australian: monkeys from kangaroos, weaver birds from cockatoos, and pheasants from parrots. This invisible boundary and the difference between the species it divides catalyzed Wallace's theory of evolution and prodded Darwin to articulate his own theory. <p>In Where Worlds Collide, van Oosterzee follows Wallace's journeys through the islands of South East Asia. She draws on Wallace's natural history travelogue, The Malay Archipelago, a book he wrote after spending the years from 1854 to 1862 in Malaysia, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Explaining his theory and how it has been interpreted by biologists, van Oosterzee also re-creates Wallace's sense of excitement with his discoveries. She devotes a chapter to the diversity of butterfly wing patterns, for example, because Wallace was so enamored of them.</p></p><p></p><h2>Humbug (2 Volume Set)</h2><p>Harvey Kurtzman changed the face of American humor when he created the legendary <i>MAD</i> comic.

In <em>Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy</em>, Tygiel penned a classic work, a landmark book that towers above most writing about the sport. Now he ranges across the last century and a half in an intriguing look at baseball as history, and history as reflected in baseball.<br> In <em>Past Time</em>, Tygiel gives us a seat behind home plate, where we catch the ongoing interplay of baseball and American society. We begin in New York in the 1850s, where pre-Civil War nationalism shaped the emergence of a "national pastime." We witness the true birth of modern baseball with the development of its elaborate statistics--the brainchild of English-born reformer, Henry Chadwick. Chadwick, Tygiel writes, created the sport's "historical essence" and even imparted a moral dimension to the game with his concepts of "errors" and "unearned" runs. Tygiel offers equally insightful looks at the role of rags-to-riches player-owners in the formation of the upstart American League and he describes the complex struggle to establish African-American baseball in a segregated world. He also examines baseball during the Great Depression (when Branch Rickey and Larry MacPhail saved the game by perfecting the farm system, night baseball, and radio broadcasts), the ironies of Bobby Thomson's immortal "shot heard 'round the world," the rapid relocation of franchises in the 1950s and 1960s, and the emergence of rotisserie leagues and fantasy camps in the 1980s. <br> In <em>Past Time</em>, Jules Tygiel provides baseball history with a difference. Instead of a pitch-by-pitch account of great games, in this groundbreaking book, the field is American history and baseball itself is the star.</p><p>In <i>Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy</i> and the follow-up <i>Jackie Robinson Reader</i>, Jules Tygiel focused his historian's eye on what was arguably baseball's most stunning single event. Dissecting it from every angle, he followed its consequences through the weft of the national fabric in a pair of consummate, readable, and marvelously entertaining books that painted an arresting portrait of a remarkable man and his remarkable ordeal. In <i>Past Time</i> Tygiel widens his focus to turn his considerable narrative and interpretive skills loose on the broader tapestry of the game itself. The result is a superb collection of essays on American history filtered through the national pastime's lens. "If there is a unifying theme"--and there certainly is--"it is that while the game of baseball itself has changed minimally since its origins, the context and format in which Americans have absorbed and appreciated the game have dramatically shifted."<p> Drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of the game, Tygiel uses the game as his doorway for entry into--and airing out--several rooms of the American past. Though the nine essays that make up <i>Past Time</i> reflect the game's nine innings and are presented chronologically, they are each entities unto themselves and can be read in any order. Rarely stepping onto the playing field, they avoid the mushiness and rhapsodizing that baseball tends to evoke. Instead, they take provocative looks at the often overlooked--like why statistics hold the game together, and why holding the game together was crucial to an America emerging from the Civil War--and fresh looks at old warhorses like baseball and the Depression era, baseball and civil rights, and baseball and America's post-World War II geographical shift. The final "inning" examines such recent obsessions as rotisserie leagues and fantasy camps, and the chapter on Bobby Thompson's famed home run and how the ways we would experience the game in the early years of the Cold War would change is thoroughly absorbing. But, then, so is the rest of <i>Past Time</i>. It has you wishing for extra "innings." <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><br><strong>Jules Tygiel</strong> is Professor of History at San Francisco State University.

From the 20,000 rolls of film he shot, he offers 200 of his best candid photos, all black and white. They show a wide range of presidential activities, from speech-writing sessions and meetings with world leaders to private family moments. Only very brief captions accompany the central photo section, but further insights are provided in a lively introduction by historian Douglas Brinkley and an interesting afterword by McNeely himself. Unfortunately, this layout and the lack of an index challenge readers to appreciate fully the photographic qualities and stories inherent in the photos, and make it difficult to find specific subject matter. For example, one photo shows Clinton and Gore in a strikingly relaxed and personal moment with the Dalai Lama "in Vice President Gore's office." Over 100 pages later, another picture shows an uncomfortable-looking Clinton with the president of China in a highly formal meeting "in the Blue Room." Both are fascinating images, but to realize their full implications, or even to find them, readers must read both introduction and afterword, awkwardly flipping back and forth to the photos referred to in the texts. Still, whether it is simply browsed for its human interest, appreciated for its photographic art, or read and studied for the insight it provides into both history and photojournalism, this is a valuable resource for citizens, students, or photography buffs.-Christine C. Menefee, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>The Chinese government's seizure of half of this book's run (8,00o of 16,000 copies) made major news. The offending shot, of Clinton touching the Dalai Lama's hand while listening to him speak during a meeting, wouldn't normally get a second glance in the U.S., since it is only the P.R.C. that considers the religious leader a dangerous dissident. The rest of the 227 b&amp;w shots presented here, representing the more than half-million frames veteran White House photographer McNeely took while following the president between 1993 and 1998, do a superb job of capturing Clinton's complexities. Artistically, the two most moving shots are of the president bathed in the ethereal glow of candles after lighting one in memory of his recently deceased mother at Kazan Cathedral in Moscow in 1994, and of the president, Russian president Boris Yeltsin and two interpretersAall in stark silhouetteAconferring at the Vancouver summit in 1993. Photographs of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton convey them as two temperamentally different poles of a shared dream, and shots of the president and the vice-president, both sharing jokes and in deep discussion, showAas eminent historian Douglas Brinkley (The Unfinished Presidency, etc.) observes in his astute introduction to the history of presidential portraiture and of McNeely's workAwhat is probably one of the most well-defined first- and second-man teams in U.S. history.

The human side of the civil war in El Salvador and decades of repression come to the fore in this woman&#39;s tale of extraordinary courage and ordinary labor.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishWhile military solutions to social problems take an awful toll in human suffering, the military's gain in wealth and power is apt to make it reluctant to support peace unless funds are cut off. Tiny, overpopulated El Salvador has recently emerged from a savage 13-year civil war that devastated the country. The war, in reality an agrarian movement to rectify the ownership of over half the land by two percent of the people, gave rise to such human rights abuses that thousands were massacred or fled abroad. Protests by women in turn made them aware of their own status as a disadvantaged group. The author herself was transformed from a peasant to an international human rights activist. Those who know Latin America will not be surprised at her story; a similar story is Nidia Diaz's I Was Never Alone: A Prison Diary from El Salvador (Ocean, 1992).

They saw that Raf's guards were released from the handcuffs and one of them was locking them on his wrists again so that his hands were behind his back, as in the chapel that morning. Julius was standing by his carriage, with his hand on the open door. It was ready to leave, by the open gate. A double row of soldiers were taking up their positions on the gravel sweep, lining up as a firing party with the front row on one knee. Stenken stood at one end to the side of the line, nearest to Rafael. Now Raf's guards left him standing alone on the other side of the gravel. "Oh no, oh no, oh no!" Catherine found she was saying over and over in her anguish. Julius called out, "Now, run for it, le Marre!" &nbsp; Rafael le Marre is in trouble again. His cousin Julius Waldemar has taken over the government, and wants the unconventional Raf out of the way - permanently. Catherine Ayre and her English cousin Giles have come to Lezenstein in the summer of 1849 and find themselves right in the middle of the political upheaval. Giles, not impressed with Raf or Grand Duke Constant, takes Duke Julius' side - to the danger of Raf and the Italian political refugees hidden at the le Marre castle of Xandeln. Julius seems to be in control, and time is running out for Raf and his friends.</p><p><p><b>Meriol Trevor</b>&nbsp;(1919- 2000) was educated at St. Hugh's College, Oxford.

The High Line is a 1.45mile stretch of disused elevated freight tracks on Manhattan&#x2019;s West Side that was converted into a park between 2006 and 2014. In 2015, the American artist Rashid Johnson (b. Chicago, Ill., 1977; lives and works in New York, N.Y.) installed a publicly accessible sculpture on the tracks. Commissioned by the High Line Art program, it consisted of a shelflike black metal construction that housed a number of bright yellow busts. Blocks presents comprehensive photographic documentation of the eponymous work&#x2019;s evolving interaction with the lush vegetation into which it intervened. Over the course of the full year for which the sculpture stood on the site, plants of different species grew through its grid structure, lending it a forever changing aspect as the seasons passed. The pictures illustrate the poetic quality of the timelimited relationship between a manmade construction and nature, touching on themes such as optimism, failure, regeneration, and desolation. A conversation between Cecilia Alemani, chief curator of High Line Art, and Rashid Johnson sheds light on the genesis of Blocks and the artist&#x2019;s approach to making work for public settings.</p><p></p><h2>Scarp</h2><p><p>AN <i>INDEPENDENT</i> BOOK OF THE YEAR </p><p>An extraordinary book by a man with a unique and inspiring perspective, SCARP will change the way you view the places and spaces around you, and reveal a forgotten London you never knew existed.</p><p>Nick Papadimitriou has spent a lifetime living on the margins, walking and documenting the landscapes surrounding his home in Child's Hill, North London, in a study he calls Deep Topography. </p><p>Part meditation on nature and walking, part memoir and part social history, his arresting debut is first and foremost a personal inquiry into the spirit of a place: a 14-mile broken ridge of land on the fringes of Northern London known as Scarp. Conspicuous but largely forgotten, a vast yet largely invisible presence hovering just beyond the metropolis, Scarp is a vast storehouse of regional memory. We join the author as he explores and reimagines this brooding, pregnant landscape, meticulously observing his surroundings, finding surprising connections and revealing lost slices of the past. </p><p>SCARP captures the satisfying experience of a long, reflective walk. Whether talking about the beauty of a bird or a telegraph pole, deaths at a roundabout or his own troubled past, Papadimitriou celebrates the poetry in the everyday. His captivating prose reveals that the world around us is alive and intrinsically valuable in ways that the trappings of day-to-day life lead us to forget, and allows us to re-connect with something more authentic, more immediate, more profound.</p></p><p>'Nick is an inspirational figure and a significant spectre. It replenishes my sense of London to know he is out there, somewhere on the western fringes, walking, prospecting, making his reports. He is the prophet of deep-topography, a post-academic discipline, learned on the hoof. You may not be aware of him, but the culture will shrivel when he is not around.' (<i>IAIN SINCLAIR, author of <i>Hackney, that Rose-Red Empire</i> and <i>London Orbital</i></i>)<br><br>'He sees magic in everything. He's like a mystic or an alchemist, hoovering up the magic of stone and brick and concrete. He's also got an incredible language at his disposal, remarkable ideas and a deep sense of lucid confusion.' (<i>RUSSELL BRAND</i>)<br><br>'In an era when the search for authenticity has become de trop, Nick Papadimitriou is a startling personification: a superb nature writer, a poet, the originator and preeminent practitioner of the discipline he has dubbed 'deep topography'. From the council flat in Child's Hill, North London, where he has lived for over a quarter century, he sets out on journeys through the urban space that have the velocity and the daring exploratory feel of interstellar voyaging. I urge you to read the results: they are haunting, strange, lyrical, poignant - a testimony to a life that is triumphantly less ordinary.' (<i>WILL SELF</i>)<br><br>The most vital document about London in years . . . brilliantly imagined . . . it's compelling singularity and off-message cultural engagement are things we should be profoundly thankful for. (<i><i>Time Out</i> *****</i>)<br><br>'Nick Papadimitriou veers closer to the topographical delirium of Iain Sinclair or JG Ballard in Scarp: a ramble through his home suburbs of north London that spreads a visionary gleam over the mysterious backwaters of the Northern Line'. (<i><i>Independent</i>, Books of the Year</i>)<br><br>Very engaging.Years of study and dreaming in the spare bedroom of his flat have given birth to a series of fantastic journeys . . . (<i><i>Observer</i></i>)<br><br>'What a strange and wonderful work it is... A series of walks across Scarp, loosely stretching from Harefield in the south-west to Hertford in the north-east, forms the main thread of the book. Nick is the perpetual outsider. He's the scruffy-looking drifter staring over your garden fence, or sleeping rough on a golf course. He's the arsonist who twice set fire to his school, and did time for burning down his neighbour's house. Yet he writes like an angel, avoiding the abstruse prose often found in "psychogeographic" writing.' (<i>www.londonist.com</i>)<br><br>'Its full of poetry - something to keep on the night-stand and dip in and out of when the mood takes you. There's a breathtaking amount of colour here, with the author adopting a point of view that makes what are in reality rather mundane suburbs seem like places of mystery and magic.' (<i>www.londoneer.org</i>)<br><br>If Will Self is partly responsible for the current popularity of psychogeographic writing, then 'deep topographer' Nick Papadimitriou deserves credit for influencing Self's thinking . . . SCARP is intense and deeply personal . . . Ultimately this isn't a book about the Scarp but about fringes - of society, cities, nature, perhaps even sanity. Self's droll psychogeographic adventures are more fun but they lack the sheer Joycean scope of Papadimitriou's ramblings: this is the hard stuff. (<i><i>Metro</i></i>)<br><br>His great achievement is demonstrating how a long walk can be a meditative healing process where one can forget what is mundane, and reconnect not only with one's inner self, but also with something deeper and even more tangible. (<i><i>We Love This Book</i></i>)An extraordinary book by a man with a unique and inspiring perspective, SCARP will change the way you view the places and spaces around you.</p><h2>Little Bear&#39;s Friend (I Can Read)</h2><p><p>This is the third book about Little Bear.

It covers a variety of mediums: watercolours, oils, acrylics and gouache, reproducing the finished paintings with close-up details to show the method of working. The work of 28 eminent miniature painters is examined, using step-by-step demonstrations and a selection of completed miniatures. Advice on frames and framing is also included.</p><p>In a book that may at first appear obscure, Burton brings to life an ancient art that, in one form or another, has never really gone out of favor. The author, cofounder and president of the Hillard Society of Miniaturists and executive secretary to the Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors, and Gravers, looks at the work of 28 eminent miniaturists. These artists have taken the inspiration of early masters like Holbein and Hillard and moved into new media and subjects. Using watercolor, enamel, oil and acrylic on copper, and paper, ivory substitutes, and vellum, they find any theme, from traditional portraits to currant buns, fair game. Unfortunately, this U.K.-produced book is not nearly as practical for American audiences as Joan Cornish Willies's Miniature Painting: A Complete Guide to Techniques, Mediums, and Surfaces (Watson-Guptill 1995). The lists of suppliers and miniature painting societies in Willies's book have U.S. rather than British addresses. Moreover, Willies explores this lush and luminous art form with greater detail and variety. With its more clearly conceived layout, Willies's is ultimately the book of choice on miniature painting for most libraries.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.It is one thing to consider miniature paintings from afar and applaud the technical virtuosities involved. It is quite another to come face-to-face with the miniaturists and their individual processes. From the author's coverage of the techniques and working habits of 28 British miniaturists, it is difficult not to appreciate the painstaking work described and illustrated. Close-up color photographs enhance the text, as do the notes from each painter. Appended is a list of miniature painting societies and a list of suppliers. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Exploring Countries and Cultures Synergy Group Guide 2015 My Father&#39;s World</h2><p>This spiral paperback book &#34;Exploring Countries and Cultures Synergy Group Guide 2015 My Father&#39;s World&#34; is preowned but is in like new condition.

Discovered by Colette, who arranged for the publication of his first novel, <i>My Friends</i>, Bove enjoyed a busy literary career, until the German occupation silenced him. During his lifetime, his novels and stories were admired by Rilke, the surrealists, Camus, and Beckett, who said of him that &#x201c;more than anyone else he has an instinct for the essential detail.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Henry Duchemin and His Shadows</i> is the ideal introduction to Bove&#x2019;s world, with its cast of stubborn isolatoes who call to mind Melville&#x2019;s Bartleby, Walser&#x2019;s &#x201c;little men,&#x201d; and Rhys&#x2019;s lost women. Henri Duchemin, the protagonist of the collection&#x2019;s first story, &#x201c;Night Crime,&#x201d; is ambivalent, afraid of appearing ridiculous, desperate for money: in other words, the perfect prey. Criminals, beautiful women, and profiteers threaten the sad young men of Bove&#x2019;s stories, but worse yet are the interior voices and paranoia that propel them to their fates. The poet of the flophouse and the dive, the park bench and the pigeon&#x2019;s crumb, Bove is also a deeply empathetic writer for whom no defeat is so great as to silence desire.</p><p><p><b>Emmanuel Bove</b> (1898&#x2013;1945) was born Emmanuel Bobovnikoff to a Jewish �migr� from Kiev and a Parisian chambermaid from Luxembourg. His childhood was spent in Paris, marked at times by extreme poverty in the company of his mother and younger brother, and wealth in the company of his father and stepmother. With his stepmother&#x2019;s patronage, Bove acquired an education in Paris, Geneva, and, during the First World War, England. Back in Paris, he began writing while supporting himself with a series of odd jobs. He had been publishing popular novels under the pseudonym Jean Vallois for several years when Colette helped him publish the novel <i>Mes amis</i> (<i>My Friends</i>) under his own name. He continued publishing successful novels until the Second World War, at which time he was forced into exile in Algeria. He died of heart failure soon after his return to Paris.<br><br> <b>Alyson Waters</b>&#x2019;s translations from the French include works by Louis Aragon, Ren� Belletto, Eric Chevillard, and Albert Cossery.

Orthofer, <i>The Complete Review</i></p><h2>Moliere: Four Plays</h2><p>As an actor and playwright, Moliere played a key role in the transition away from the Italian Commedia Dell&#x2019;Arte to the ever popular la Com�die Fran�aise. Moliere broke away from the impromptu, formula-mask type presentations which were rooted in the Italian Renaissance theater, and introduced live, written dialogue based on the people and costumes of the day&#x2014;real people whose characters acceded the stage, and the audience made its connection with each foible enacted by the performing protagonists. Thus, the satire in the Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme became poignant and entertaining. In L&#x2019;Avare, Moliere gave the miser a physical body that was believable and real. In this anthology containing four of Moliere most popular plays, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor In Spite of Himself, The Affected Damsels, The Miser (regular edition), and The Miser (short edition), Mr. Pergolizzi translates a French master of the theater in fluent and modern English ready for performance, on any American stage.</p><p>Carl Milo Pergolizzi, the translator, is famous in and around the stages of New York, where he lives.

The new country was then driven by a belief in a political construct, the idea of India, an idea that for decades animated the citizens' efforts to unite their huge, diverse, and poor society and to transform it into a modern state fit to join the irreversible movement of world history. <p>Sunil Khilnani's exciting book addresses the paradoxes and ironies that have surrounded this project of inventing India--a project that has brought Indians considerable political freedom and carried their enormous democracy to the verge of being Asia's greatest free state but that has also left many of them in poverty and that is now threatened by divisive religious nationalism. </p><p>Khilnani's superb historical analysis conveys modern India's energy, fluidity, and unpredictability--in its democracy and its voting patterns, in its visions of economic development, in its diverse cities and devotion to village culture, and in its current disputes over its political identity.

Ms. Banks lives in the South of France, and Mr. Hallensleben lives in Paris, France.<br><br>*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. The creators of numerous acclaimed picture books offer another winning title in this deceptively quiet story about a well-loved vacation house. In summer, the rooms burst with life--the crickets sing, laundry floats on the line, and children's voices rise "like dandelion puff." Then fall comes, the people leave, and the empty house is quiet. "Or is it?" Banks' describes the house's secret life through fall, winter, and spring: the faucet drips, snow falls, a bird builds a nest, a cat roams and sleeps. At last, another summer arrives, and new kittens and birds share the house with the returned family. In spare, poetic sentences, Banks' precise sounds and cyclical rhythms amplify the hypnotic sensory impressions, which Banks invites listeners to imagine: "The cat stretches out across the bed and settles into a secret dream. Listen to her purring." Another artist might have chosen subdued grays and purples to depict a house shuttered for winter, but Hallensleben's beautiful, thickly brushed, impressionistic paintings evoke a sense of noise and life in rooms painted shocking blue and rich, bright red. Scenes of rooms glimpsed through half-open doors and of quiet corners extend the words' message that many of life's exciting stories lie in small moments and partial glimpses.

Three out of four Americans say they feel more fearful today then they did twenty years ago. <i>The Culture of Fear </i> describes the high costs of living in a fear-ridden environment where realism has become rarer than doors without deadbolts.Why do we have so many fears these days? Are we living in exceptionally dangerous times? To watch the news, you'd certainly think so, but Glassner demonstrates that it is our <i>perception</i> of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. <i>The Culture of Fear</i> is an expose of the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as rates for both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV newsmagazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.Glassner spells out the prices we pay for social panics: the huge sums of money that go to waste on unnecessary programs and products as well as time and energy spent worrying about our fears.</p><p>Americans are afraid of many things that shouldn't frighten them, writes Barry Glassner in this book devoted to exploding conventional wisdom. Thanks to opportunistic politicians, single-minded advocacy groups, and unscrupulous TV "newsmagazines," people must unlearn their many misperceptions about the world around them. The youth homicide rate, for instance, has dropped by as much as 30 percent in recent years, says Glassner--and up to three times as many people are struck dead by lightening than die by violence in schools. "False and overdrawn fears only cause hardship," he writes. In fact, one study shows that daughters of women with breast cancer are actually <i>less</i> likely to conduct self-examinations--probably because the campaign to increase awareness of the ailment also inadvertently heightens fears. <p> Although some sections are stronger than others, <i>The Culture of Fear</i>'s examination of many nonproblems--such as "road rage," "Internet addiction," and airline safety--is very good. Glassner also has a sharp eye for what causes unnecessary goose bumps: "The use of poignant anecdotes in place of scientific evidence, the christening of isolated incidents as trends, depictions of entire categories of people as innately dangerous," and unknown scholars who masquerade as "experts." Although Glassner rejects the notion that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, he certainly shows we have much less to fear than we think. And isn't that sort of scary? <i>--John J.

This is an exploration of her relationship with the literary form we have come to know as "science fiction,&#x201d;&nbsp;a relationship&nbsp;that has been lifelong, stretching from her days as a child reader in the 1940s, through her time as a graduate student at Harvard, where she worked on the Victorian ancestor of the form, and continuing as a writer and reviewer.&nbsp; This book brings together her three heretofore unpublished Ellmann Lectures from 2010: "Flying Rabbits," which begins with Atwood's early&nbsp; rabbit superhero creations, and goes on to speculate about masks, capes, weakling alter egos, and Things with Wings; "Burning Bushes," which follows her into Victorian otherlands and beyond; and "Dire Cartographies," which investigates Utopias and Dystopias.&nbsp; <i>In Other Worlds</i> also includes some of Atwood's key reviews and thoughts about the form. Among those writers discussed are Marge Piercy, Rider Haggard, Ursula Le Guin, Ishiguro, Bryher, Huxley, and Jonathan Swift. She elucidates the differences (as she sees them) between "science fiction" proper, and "speculative fiction," as well as between&nbsp;"sword and sorcery/fantasy" and "slipstream fiction." For all readers who have loved <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, <i>Oryx and Crake</i>, and <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, <i>In Other Worlds</i> is a must.</p></p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD is the internationally acclaimed author of more than forty books.

Margaret Atwood lives in Toronto.<i>I&#x2019;m a fifty-three-year-old writer who can remember being a ten-year-old writer and who expects someday to be an eighty-year-old writer.</i><br>OCTAVIA BUTLER<br><br><b>I</b><i>n Other Worlds </i>is not a catalogue of science fiction, a grand theory about it, or a literary history of it. It is not a treatise, it is not definitive, it is not exhaustive, it is not canonical. It is not the work of a practising academic or an official guardian of a body of knowledge. Rather it is an exploration of my own lifelong relationship with a literary form, or forms, or subforms, both as reader and as writer.<br>&nbsp;<br>I say &#x201c;lifelong,&#x201d; for among the first things I wrote as a child might well merit the initials SF. Like a great many children before and since, I was an inventor of other worlds. Mine were rudimentary, as such worlds are when you&#x2019;re six or seven or eight, but they were emphatically not of this here- and- now Earth, which seems to be one of the salient features of SF. I wasn&#x2019;t much interested in <i>Dick and Jane: </i>the creepily ultra- normal characters did not convince me. Saturn was more my speed, and other realms even more outlandish. Several- headed man- eating marine life seemed more likely to me, somehow, than Spot and Puff.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Our earliest loves, like revenants, have a way of coming back in other forms; or, to paraphrase Wordsworth, the child is mother to the woman. To date&#x2014; as what I am pleased to think of as an adult&#x2014; I have written three full- length fictions that nobody would ever class as sociological realism: <i>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale</i>, <i>Oryx and Crake</i>, and <i>The Year of the Flood</i>. Are these books &#x201c;science fiction&#x201d;? I am often asked. Though sometimes I am not asked, but told: I am a silly nit or a snob or a genre traitor for dodging the term because these books are as much &#x201c;science fiction&#x201d; as <i>Nineteen Eighty- Four </i>is, whatever I might say. But is <i>Nineteen Eighty- Four </i>as much &#x201c;science fiction&#x201d; as <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>? I might reply. I would answer not, and therein lies the distinction.<br>&nbsp;<br>Much depends on your nomenclatural allegiances, or else on your system of literary taxonomy. Back in 2008, I was talking to a much younger person about &#x201c;science fiction.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d been asked by the magazine <i>New Scientist </i>to answer the question &#x201c;Is science fiction going out of date?&#x201d; But then I realized that I couldn&#x2019;t make a stab at the answer because I didn&#x2019;t really grasp what the term <i>science fiction </i>meant anymore. Is this term a corral with real fences that separate what is clearly &#x201c;science fiction&#x201d; from what is not, or is it merely a shelving aid, there to help workers in bookstores place the book in a semi- accurate or at least lucrative way? If you put skin- tight black or silver clothing on a book cover along with some jetlike flames and/or colourful planets, does that make the work &#x201c;science fiction&#x201d;? What about dragons and manticores, or backgrounds that contain volcanoes or atomic clouds, or plants with tentacles, or landscapes reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch? Does there have to be any actual science in such a book, or is the skin- tight clothing enough? These seemed to me to be open questions.<br>&nbsp;<br>This much younger person&#x2014; let&#x2019;s call him Randy, which was in fact his name&#x2014; did not have a hard and fast definition of &#x201c;science fiction,&#x201d; but he knew it when he saw it, kind of. As I told <i>New Scientist, </i>&#x201c;For Randy&#x2014; and I think he&#x2019;s representative&#x2014; sci- fi does include other planets, which may or may not have dragons on them. It includes the wildly paranormal&#x2014; not your aunt table- tilting or things going creak, but shape- shifters and people with red eyeballs and no pupils, and Things taking over your body.&#x201d; Here I myself would include such items as Body Snatchers&#x2014; if of extraterrestrial rather than folkloric provenance&#x2014; and Pod People, and heads growing out of your armpits, though I&#x2019;d exclude common and garden- variety devils, and demonic possession, and also vampires and werewolves, which have literary ancestries and categories all their own.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reported in my <i>New Scientist </i>article, for Randy sci- fi includes, as a matter of course, spaceships, and Mad Scientists, and Experiments Gone Awfully Wrong. Plain ordinary horror doesn&#x2019;t count&#x2014; chainsaw murderers and such. Randy and I agreed that you might meet one of those walking along the street. It&#x2019;s what you definitely would not meet walking along the street that makes the grade. Randy judged such books in part by the space- scapes and leathery or silvery outfits on their covers, which means that my speculations about jacket images are not entirely irrelevant. As one friend&#x2019;s child put it: &#x201c;Looks like milk, tastes like milk&#x2014; it IS milk!&#x201d; Thus: looks like science fiction, has the tastes of science fiction&#x2014; it IS science fiction!<br>&nbsp;<br>Or more or less. Or kind of. For covers can be misleading. The earliest mass- market paperbacks of my first two novels, <i>The Edible Woman </i>and <i>Surfacing, </i>had pink covers with gold scrollwork designs on them and oval frames with a man&#x2019;s head and a woman&#x2019;s head silhouetted inside, just like valentines. How many readers picked these books up, hoping to find a Harlequin Romance or reasonable facsimile, only to throw them down in tears because there are no weddings at the ends?<br>&nbsp;<br>Then there was the case of the former Soviet Union. No sooner did the Wall come down in 1989 than pornography flooded across the one- time divide. Porn had hitherto been excluded in favour of endless editions of the classics and other supposed- to- be- good- for- you works, but forbidden fruit excites desire, and everyone had already read Tolstoy, a lot. Suddenly the publishers of serious literature were hard- pressed. Thus it was that <i>The Robber Bride </i>appeared in a number of Soviet- bloc countries with covers that might be described as&#x2014; at best&#x2014; deceptive and&#x2014; at worst&#x2014; as a Eurotrash slutfest <i>in flagrante. </i>How many men in raincoats purchased the <i>Robber Bride </i>edition sporting a black- satin- sheathed Zenia with colossal tits, hoping for a warm one- handed time in a back corner, only to heave it into the bin with a strangled <i>Foiled Again! </i>curse? For the Zenia in my book performs what we can only assume is her sexual witchery offstage.<br>&nbsp;<br>Having thus misled readers twice&#x2014; inadvertently&#x2014; by dint of book covers and the genre categories implied by them, I would rather not do it again. I would like to have space creatures inside the books on offer at my word- wares booth, and I would if I could: they were, after all, my first childhood love. But, being unable to produce them, I don&#x2019;t want to lead the reader on, thus generating a frantic search within the pages&#x2014; <i>Where are the Lizard Men of Xenor?</i>&#x2014; that can only end in disappointment.<br>&nbsp;<br>My desire to explore my relationship with the SF world, or worlds, has a proximate cause. In 2009, I published <i>The Year of the Flood, </i>the second work of fiction in a series exploring another kind of &#x201c;other world&#x201d;&#x2014; our own planet in a future. (I carefully say <i>a </i>future rather than <i>the </i>future because the future is an unknown: from the moment <i>now, </i>an infinite number of roads lead away to &#x201c;the future,&#x201d; each heading in a different direction.)<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>G-Man Volume 1: Learning To Fly (G-man, 1)</h2><p>When Mikey G unlocks the powers of his family&#39;s magic blanket, he is transformed into G-Man, the newest kid superhero on the block! G-Man joins his superhero friends Billy Demon, Tan Man, Suntrooper, and the Spark on their very first superhero adventure. But what are they to do when their enemy is Kid Thunder, son of the city&#39;s greatest champion, Captain Thunderman? And will G-Man&#39;s big brother, Great Man, prove to be friend or foe?</p><p>With the obvious appeal of young superpowered boys to real young boys, you might think the ranks of graphic novels would be spilling over with them. Well, the pickings have been pretty slim, actually, though the arrival of G-Man somewhat makes up for that oversight. G-Man is a decent little guy whose won&#x2019;t-quit attitude and clever commandeering of the family&#x2019;s magic blanket brings him and his friends into contention with a mean older brother and finally Kid Thunder, bully of the sky. With no higher aspirations than a rousing bit of fun and can-do kid adventure, G-Man hits all the right notes, from its friendly cartoon figures to the occasionally hilarious one-liners. Even the much shorter adventures and single-page gags that fill more than half the book will divert the attention of daydreaming boys. Put it alongside Scott Christian Sava&#x2019;s Hyperactive (2008), Marvel&#x2019;s recent Franklin Richards comics, and Jake Bell&#x2019;s Amazing Adventures of Nate Banks series (which Giarrusso illustrated), and you&#x2019;ve more or less cornered the male pretween superhero market.

As Gopnik makes clear, Thiebaud is famous for his lush early &#39;60s paintings of cakes, other sweets and people eating them, but this book and the exhibition it documentsAput together by chief curator Nash of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, who also provides an essayAreveal the painter to be preoccupied with a larger slice of American life. The impossible perspectives and multigraded blues and yellows of the cityscapes here seem more bizarrely true to San Francisco than stills from Vertigo. Heavy Traffic, Deli Bowls, Tie Rack and Rabbit are just what they say they are, yet their surfaces coax us into looking at them harder and longer than such banal objects could possibly entice on their own. Such dressings-up themselves are commonplace in media-saturated American life, and Thiebaud redirects their energy unerringly throughout the 160 illustrations here, most in color. One might wish for a less insidery guide to the work than Gopnik&#39;s, but the panache of his biographical prose carries readers right into the paintings, well and comprehensively selected by Nash, whose own essay provides welcome detail on Thiebaud&#39;s working life.

The forced marriage of her niece to a cruel and depraved older man, and her discovery of the harem of sex slaves kept by another cousin, makes her more determined than ever to defend the rights of women in her country. Her cause is given an extra sense of urgency against the backdrop of increased dissent against the Al Sa&#39;uds, and the looming spectre of Islamic Fundamentalism.</p><p>Jean Sasson grew up in a small town in America&#39;s deep south before moving to the Middle East in 1978 to work at a prestigious royal hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In 1985, she met Princess Sultana, who inspired the widely acclaimed Princess Trilogy. Jean later worked as freelance writer in Lebanon and Kuwait, conducting interviews with Kuwaitis who survived the first Gulf war, as well as high ranking Kuwaiti officials before, during and after the War. Her affection for the Middle East has been the motivation for a number of her books and Jean has spent her career sharing the personal stories of many courageous women. Princess: Stepping Out Of The Shadows is the latest book in the bestselling Princess series.</p><h2>Crucial Decisions</h2><p>It was poor policymaking by corporate heads that brought Lockheed and Chrysler to the brink of bankruptcy; it was the failure of top managers to respond to new market conditions in the early 1980s that led to the demise of hundreds of corporations, both large and small; and it was &#34;quick-and-easy&#34; decisions by Presidents Kennedy and Reagan that resulted in serious mistakes in foreign policy. Now, Irving Janis, one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on decisionmaking, presents a comprehensive analysis that shows corporate executives, government and organizational policymakers, and general managers how to avoid making critical errors and ensure quality in making vital decisions. Using cogent evidence and illustrations from studies of top-level policymakers in government, business, and public welfare organizations, Janis shows how the likelihood of failure is substantially reduced if sound procedures of information search, appraisal, and planning are used. He alerts executives to the preconditions, precipitating events, and catalysts that create situations where the most dangerous error of decisionmaking -- relying on simplistic decision rules -- often occurs. For issues perceived as routine or unimportant, Janis contends that policymakers typically resort to a &#34;quick-and-easy&#34; or &#34;seat-of-the-pants&#34; approach to decisionmaking. When that judgment is objectively incorrect, the results can be disastrous. Similarly, critical mistakes are made by policymakers coping with problems they regard as serious when they give priority to constraints which result in failure to carry out the crucial steps of effective problemsolving. By following the four essential steps outlined by Janis, policymakers can adopt &#34;vigilant problem solving,&#34; the high-quality procedural strategy for arriving at policy decisions When policymakers utilize the vigilant problem solving approach, they are likely to take full account of the various constraints involved in a situation and may even seek out additional information about them. Consequently, the risk of failure, especially in critical situations, is substantially lowered. Janis also details how executives can deal with challenging threats and opportunities and reveals what specific leadership practices are likely to improve crisis management. A profile of twenty leadership practices will help managers function as effective executives who practice and promote high-quality decisionmaking on issues that affect the vital interests of the organization. A set of seventeen characteristics for selecting the best personnel for policymaking positions is also provided to aid managers in reducing their sources of error. Janis&#39; highly acclaimed decisionmaking strategies give a powerful advantage to managers in all kinds of organizations, from the smallest family business to the largest corporation and government agency.</p><p><b>Irving L. Janis</b> is adjunct professor of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Yale, and author of two landmark books, <i>Groupthink</i> and, with Leon Mann, <i>Decision Making</i> (The Free Press).<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Order Out of Theoretical Chaos?</b> </p><p> Causes of Successful Versus Unsuccessful Outcomes </p><p> Leaders of governments, major business corporations, and other large organizations typically make policy decisions with the expectation that the outcomes will be sufficiently successful to achieve fairly well the objectives they have in mind. But all too often they are bitterly disappointed. Obviously, several different causes contribute to unsuccessful outcomes. </p><p> Unforeseeable obstacles to effective implementation and uncontrollable events, such as countermoves by adversaries or competitors, can drastically interfere to such an extent that the policy does not work out as intended. Another contributing cause of unsuccessful policy outcomes consists of the leaders' oversimplified beliefs and ideological stereotypes that give rise to faulty assumptions about the requirements for a good solution or about the consequences of their choice. Even when policymakers are open-minded and conscientious about obtaining factual information pertinent to the policy question they are grappling with, the available evidence may be too ambiguous to indicate that their assumptions are wrong. In other instances, the cause of a policy fiasco can be attributed mainly to misleading information that the policymakers had no way of knowing was erroneous because it came from seemingly dependable intelligence reports or the testimony of experts, with no signs of contradictions or lack of consensus. Then, too, there are unknown and chance factors that can adversely affect the outcome, commonly called "bad luck." Nevertheless, among the major causes of unsuccessful outcomes is one that is very much under the leaders' control: <i>poor quality of the decisionmaking procedures used either to arrive at a new policy or to reaffirm the existing policy.</i> </p><p> Defective procedures -- entailing, for example, inadequate information search, biased appraisal of consequences, and lack of contingency planning -- do not guarantee that a policy decision will turn out to be a fiasco. The net influence of the uncontrollable, unknown, and chance factors can occasionally result in "good luck." But the likelihood of failure is substantially less if sound procedures of information search, appraisal, and planning are used. (Evidence bearing on this important point will be presented later, in Chapter 6.) </p><p> Some of the causal sequences that lead to defective policymaking procedures in government, business firms, and public welfare organizations are well known to practically all executives. For example, when a chief executive is provoked to anger, or becomes extremely apprehensive or extremely elated in response to a sensational event, he or she might decide impulsively to make a drastic change in policy, while dominated by the mood of the moment, without consulting any advisors who could point out flaws and suggest better alternatives to be considered. Or, after a fair amount of information search and deliberation about fresh alternatives to an old policy that has turned sour, the members of an executive committee might conform to powerful social pressures from the chief executive. Sometimes policy advisors assent to what they regard as an inferior choice rather than facing the damaging personal consequences of arguing against the chief's pet initiative. These and a number of other, less wellknown, pathways to failure will be elaborated in detail in this book. The defective pathways will be contrasted with a pathway embodying high-quality procedures that increase the chances of successful outcomes. Much of the inquiry will focus on multiple causes for deviating from the latter pathway. Special attention will be given to the preconditions, precipitating events, and catalysts arising from the current situational context, which play a significant role in determining whether executives will use good or poor procedures to arrive at a major policy decision when vital interests of the nation or organization are at stake. </p><p> Avoiding Policy Disasters That Could Be Lethal </p><p> In a comprehensive review of research on "leadership and power," Edwin Hollander points out that a president who is popular can carry out the main functions of a policymaker expeditiously, with a minimum of resistance from other powerholders, but the president's policy decisions can turn out to be very poor ones that result in disastrous losses. The same can be said about top-level leaders in any organization. Among the defective pathways that lead to disastrous policy decisions are those that fail to correct <i>avoidable</i> errors -- rectifiable misperceptions, refutable false assumptions, resolvable ignorance, and remediable lapses in judgment concerning the probability or magnitude of expected costs and benefits. Those pathways can prove to be destructive in several ways: The outcome can turn out to be lethal for the careers of the responsible leaders, for the continued existence of the organization, and sometimes for the very lives of large numbers of people who are affected by a major policy decision. </p><p> Conventional wisdom says that there is only one answer to the question, "What needs to be done if the top-level leaders repeatedly make poor policy decisions that turn out to be detrimental to vital interests of their organization?" The well-known answer is that they should be fired before they cause such lethal damage that the organization itself cannot survive. But there is evidence suggesting that this bit of conventional wisdom is seldom heeded? William Starbuck, a specialist in management studies who has investigated the survival rates of governmental agencies and business firms, has this to say about what often happens to top-level leaders and their organizations: </p><p> Many organizations drift along, perceiving that they are succeeding in stable environments, until they suddenly find themselves confronted by existence-threatening crises? Most of the organizations my colleagues and I have studied did not survive their crises, but in every case of survival, the reorientations included wholesale replacements of the top managers, and we infer that survival requires this.... </p><p> ...Crises evidently afflict all kinds of organizations, although they may be more likely in bureaucracies that have recently enjoyed great success? Some organizations facing crises...replace their top managers, reorient, and survive More organizations...die. Thus, nonadaptiveness turns organizations into temporary systems, nearly all of which have short lives? The 50-year-old corporations represent only 2 percent of those initially created, and 50-year-old Federal agencies only 4 percent (Starbuck &amp; Nystrom, 1981)....Approximately 30 percent of the 50-year-old corporations can be expected to disappear within ten years, as can 26 percent of the 50-year-old Federal agencies. (Starbuck 1983, pp. 100-101) </p><p> Starbuck's conclusion is that "because organizations modify their behavior programs mainly in small increments that make sense to top managers, they change too little and inappropriately, and nearly all organizations disappear within a few years." </p><p> Even if the extremely low survival rates emphasized by Starbuck are somewhat exaggerated, the general thrust of his conclusion may prove to be well warranted for business firms and nongovernmental welfare organizations, such as hospitals, clinics, schools, legal aid societies, social service, child welfare, charity, and philanthropic institutions. Jeffrey Pfeffer and other leading scholars in the field of management studies concur that a substantial percentage of organizations in the private sector go out of existence every year, most notably among small retail and service firms in highly competitive areas. Many of those failures probably are the result of defective policymaking by the owners or managers, but at present there are no depe</p></p><h2>Collected shorter poems, 1927-1957</h2><p>W. H. Auden was once described as the Picasso of modern poetry - a tribute to his ceaseless experimentation with form and subject matter. Beginning with Anglo-Saxon poetry and ending with an Horatian expansiveness and conversational sweep, this volume is essential reading for anyone seriously interested in modern poetry after T. S. Eliot.In his lifetime a controversial, outspoken, yet enigmatic, writer, Auden has gradually come to seem an intimate poet, as we have learned to read him correctly. This volume is the best possible introduction to his consummate craftsmanship and his unparalleled originality which made him the master-poet of his generation.</p><p>W. H. Auden was born in York in 1907 and brought up in Birmingham. His first book, Poems, was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber in 1930. He went to Spain during the civil war, to Iceland (with Louis MacNeice) and later travelled to China. In 1939 he and Christopher Isherwood left for America, where Auden spent the next fifteen years lecturing, reviewing, writing poetry and opera librettos, and editing anthologies. He became an American citizen in 1946, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948. In 1956 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and a year later went to live in Kirchstetten in Austria, after spending several summers on Ischia. He died in Vienna in 1973.</p><h2>Path of the Seer (Path of the Eldar)</h2><p>The second book in the best selling Eldar series by Gav Thorpe<p>The ancient eldar are a mysterious race and each devotes their life to a chosen path that will guide their actions and decide their fate.

The body you built through movement during the first several years of your life was meant to be the foundation from which you would continue to add strength, power and resiliency. Your body was meant to be strong, graceful, powerful, fluid, mobile and resilient. You were never meant to be broken, weak, fragile, stiff or injured. You were never meant to just &#34;fall apart&#34; with age. You are supposed to be able to conquer mountains, and even playgrounds, well into your golden years. You are supposed to enjoy this life with vitality. But, many of us do not. Many of us are just watching life go by. We have lost our way. We have lost our foundation. Our sedentary lifestyles have robbed us of the foundation and the joy of movement that we built as children. Because of this, we have lost our strength, our health, our resiliency and our vitality. Thankfully, we were indeed made to move. Through movement, specific movements, we can regain our foundation of strength, our foundation of health. We can become the strong, powerful, and graceful bodies that we were meant to be. We can enjoy this life with vitality. We don&#39;t have to be spectators, merely existing. We were made for adventure, for life! We can regain our Original Strength - our foundation. We can help our bodies remember how to move again and in doing so, we can become strong, healthy and resilient; like we were meant to be.

Experience its history, landscapes, towns, villages, people, cuisine, and above all, its wines and vineyards as he journeys through the sunbaked hillsides and moonlit valleys. <i>Tuscany and Its Wines</i> evokes the Tuscan magic from dawn to dusk. Traveling from town to town, through wheat fields and farmland, Johnson not only explores the Tuscan geography and wineries, but shares the culture and sitesfrom a beautiful cathedral in Siena to a good place for a drink in Monte Amiata. Johnson's illuminating descriptions, wisdom, and knowledge coupled with more than 100 breathtaking photographs capture the very essence of Tuscany and bring the author's passion for the region's distinctive grape varietals to life. <i>Tuscany and Its Wines</i> is for everyone enthralled by Tuscany's sacred marriage of light and landscape, food and wine, beauty and history.</p><p>It's a land in which "vineyard management" used to mean allowing the grapevines to wrap themselves up to the full height of elm and poplar trees. With <i>Tuscany and Its Wines</i>, prolific British wine author Hugh Johnson and peripatetic photographer Andy Katz bring this land of Chianti to a coffee table near you. More than three decades after the publication of his first book, Johnson manages here, in 144 pages bursting with dozens of gorgeous full-color photos (a few of which, alas, are uncaptioned), to take the reader on a breathless--and breathy--tour of one of the most celebrated regions in Italy, with narrative reminiscent of a particularly chatty uncle who's just picked you up at the train depot. And, as with many an avuncular itinerary, breathless narration can often leave you panting. Anyone unfamiliar with Tuscany may find themselves, after the endless parade of Certosa di Galluzos, Colli Fiorentinis, Ugo Contini Bonacossis, or Tenuta di Capezzanas, reaching--if not for a big carafe of Vino Nobile--for the drawn maps at the start of each chapter to determine whether these names are villages, Italian nobility, or local wines. But breathy quickly turns breezy as Johnson's evocative prose (the tannins of one Sangiovese are "invigorating, like a rough towel"; a particular hillside vineyard is a "green corduroy of vines") takes you jauntily to the town of Impruneta, producer of authentic terra cotta; Sant'Andrea, where Machiavelli wrote his treatise on power, <i>The Prince</i>; the villa at Vignamaggio, birthplace of Monna Lisa Gherardini, a.k.a. the Mona Lisa; and the city of Pistoia, whence the Germans coined the term "pistol" for the "nasty dagger carried under every Pistoiese's cloak." Italians, too, have a word--<i>villegiatura</i>--to denote the wish of escape from the city to a hillside villa. <i>Tuscany and Its Wines</i> may not replace a summer in Siena, but it's a dandy travel brochure. <i>--Tony Mason</i>Hugh Johnson is the world's preeminent writer on wine and has authored numerous books on the subject. His first book, Wine, has international sales totaling over seven million copies, and his classic World Atlas of Wine is now in its fourth edition.

Their friend Frances and Patricia Anne's widowed daughter Haley jump at the chance to join them, so Patricia Anne kisses her ever-loving spouse Fred good-bye, with instructions for watering the plants and feeding the dog, and the girls pack up the car and head south for some fun in the sun. <p>No one's against a little excitement, least of all Mary Alice, and watching the sun go down on the beautiful shores of the Gulf of Mexico looks pretty tame...until a dead body washes up in the gentle waves. Since Mary Alice has managed to make the acquaintance of just about everyone in sight, the murder victim is no stranger to the sisters and they feel obliged to find the killer. But with no witnesses to the crime except a few great blue herons, the sisters have no choice but to bypass the clueless police and follow their own instincts down a murky trail of dirty real-estate deals, giant sea turtle habitats, and enough big money interests to point to a mammoth motive for murder. </p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.Not too many waves, though--just enough to put a dent in the vacation that retired schoolteacher Patricia Anne Hollowell and her much-married sister, Mary Alice Crane, have planned with their friend Frances Zata and Patricia Anne's daughter Haley. Mary Alice (she's Sister, the hefty one with the dyed hair and the brassy laugh) owns a condo in the almost-fashionable Florida fishing village of Destin that seems to offer her and Patricia Anne (she's Mouse, the petite one) a respite from the dreary round of kudzu, barbecue, and Piggly Wigglys back home in Alabama. So the ladies pile into their car and arrive at Destin, land of Gulf sunsets and land fraud, just in time to admire resident manager Millicent Weatherby's new makeover before she gets killed. The obvious suspect is Millicent's incorrigibly flirtatious husband Fairchild, but a little nosing around--well, enough nosing around to uncover a second body--suggests that Millicent's surprisingly extensive holdings in the Blue Bay Ranch development made her vulnerable to a wide array of miscreants. Even so, the emphasis in the sisters' hardcover debut--they're veterans of three paperbacks--is on their domestic fun (with no men around, they take breaks from driving whenever they like, and Mouse gets her own hair disastrously dyed); the mystery carries about as much weight as a nice bit of gossip at a family reunion. A regional aimed at Joan Hess's fans, though considerably gentler in its bite. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p>
